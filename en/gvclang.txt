 GSview Help
1Overview
-Overview
?Overview
 `GSview` is a graphical interface for Ghostscript under MS-Windows,
 OS/2 and GNU/Linux.
 Ghostscript is an interpreter for the PostScript page description language
 used by laser printers.
 For documents following the Adobe PostScript Document Structuring
 Conventions, GSview allows selected pages to be viewed or printed.
 GSview 5.0 requires Ghostscript 7.04 - 9.99.

3Obtaining Ghostscript
-Obtaining_Ghostscript
?Obtaining Ghostscript
 GSview needs GPL Ghostscript.  GSview and Ghostscript
 are available separately from
  http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/
 To configure GSview, obtain and install both Ghostscript
 and GSview, then run GSview.
3Ghostscript Installation
-Ghostscript_Installation
?Ghostscript Installation
W
 GPL Ghostscript for Win32 is available as a self extracting
 archive which installs itself.
P
 GPL Ghostscript for OS/2 is available as a zip file which
 you must manually install.
X
 GPL Ghostscript is available as an RPM package, or as source code
 which you have to compile.
E
 For details of how to manually install Ghostscript, please read
 the Ghostscript documentation files Install.htm and Use.htm
3Uninstalling GSview

?Manual uninstallation
P
 To uninstall GSview, remove the files in the `gsview ` directory.
 Also remove
  c:\os2\gvpm.ini
 from the appropriate system directory.

 Remove the `GSview ` object from the desktop.

 To manually uninstall Ghostscript, remove the files in the `gsN.NN`
 directory where N.NN is the version number of Ghostscript.
W
 To uninstall GSview, remove the files in the `gsview ` directory.
 Also remove
  c:\windows\gsview32.ini
 from the appropriate system directory.

 For Windows NT you may also need to remove gsview32.ini
 from user profile directories.

 Remove the `Ghostgum` group from the Program Manager or Start menu

 If you know how to edit the registry, remove the following keys:
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\psfile
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.eps
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.ps
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/postscript
 If you associated PDF with GSview you will also need to remove
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\pdffile
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.pdf
  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MIME\Database\Content Type\application/pdf

 The preferred method to uninstall Ghostscript is
 using `Add/Remove Programs` from the Windows `Control Panel`.

 To manually uninstall Ghostscript, remove the files in the `gsN.NN`
 directory where N.NN is the version number of Ghostscript.
X
 If you installed GSview using the RPM package, use `rpm` to uninstall it.

 Otherwise, remove `gsview`, `gsview-help`, `pstotext` and `epstool`
 from the /usr/bin directory,
 the documentation in `/usr/share/doc/gsview-N.N`
 and `/usr/etc/gsview/printer.ini`.
 The exact paths may vary depending on how GSview was compiled.
E
3Manual Installation
-Manual_Installation
?Manual Installation
X
 Copy `gsview`, `gsview-help`, `epstool` and `pstotext`
 to a directory on your search path.
 Copy `gvx*.htm` to the directory `/usr/share/doc/gsview-N.NN`.
 Copy `printer.ini` to the directory `/usr/etc/gsview/printer.ini`.
WP
 It is recommended that you use the installation program for installing
 GSview.  The following instructions describe how to install GSview
 without using the installation program.

 Set the environment variable TEMP to point to a directory for
 temporary files.  For example:
   SET TEMP=c:\temp
 The directory must exist and must be writeable.

 First you need to install Ghostscript, plus its library files and fonts.
 You need the Ghostscript version listed in `Overview`.
 This version of GSview will not work with other versions of Ghostscript.
 Install Ghostscript in a directory c:\gs\gsN.NN
 (Replace N.NN by the Ghostscript version number.)

 Make a directory c:\ghostgum\gsview

 Next install
P
 PM GSview by copying gvpm.exe, gvpgs.exe,
 gvpmde.dll, gvpmes.dll, gvpmfr.dll, gvpmit.dll,
 gvpmen.hlp, gvpmde.hlp, gvpmes.hlp, gvpmfr.hlp, gvpmit.hlp
 and printer.ini
W
 GSview for Windows by copying gsview32.exe, gsv16spl.exe, gvwgs32.exe,

 gsviewen.hlp, gsviewde.hlp, gsviewes.hlp, gsviewfr.hlp, gsviewit.hlp
 and printer.ini
WP
 to the `c:\ghostgum\gsview` directory.

P
 Start GSview then follow the instructions given in the
 configuration wizard.  This will automatically configure
 `Options` | `Advanced Configure`, copy a list of known
 printers to the INI file,
 and create a GSview program object on the desktop.

 If you want to run the configure wizard later, use
 `Options` | `Easy Configure`.
W
 Start GSview and select the appropriate version of Ghostscript
 (usually the latest).  To change this later, use
 `Options` | `Easy Configure`.
E

 For more control over configuration, see `Advanced Manual Installation`.
3Advanced Manual Installation
-Advanced_Manual_Installation
?Advanced Manual Installation
WP
 Instead of using `Options` | `Easy Configure`, use
 `Options` | `Advanced Configure`.

 First correctly set the three text fields (see `Advanced Configure`).

P
 Exit GSview, then append printer.ini to the GSview INI file
 (c:\os2\gvpm.ini).

 Create a desktop program object for GSview, associating it
 with the file extensions .ps, .eps and .pdf.

W
 On the `Advanced Configure` dialog, either select the checkboxes
 `Copy printer defaults`, `Associate .ps files with GSview` and
 `Create Start Menu items`, or perform the following three steps.

 1. Exit GSview, then append printer.ini to the GSview INI file
 (c:\windows\gsview32.ini)

 2. Add the .ps and .eps (and optionally the .pdf) file types to
 the `Registry`.

 3. Create a Program Manager or Start Menu item for GSview.
X
 After starting GSview, use `Options` | `Advanced Configure`.
 Set the Ghostscript version number to match your copy of Ghostscript.
 If `gs -h` reports 5.50, enter 550.  If `gs -h` reports 6.50, enter 650.
 Correctly set the following three text fields (see `Advanced Configure`).
E

 If you have some Type 1 fonts on your system, it may be possible to
 tell Ghostscript to use them.  See `Fontmap.os2` and `Fontmap.atm`
 supplied with Ghostscript for examples.  See the `Fonts` topic.

 If you have problems, try reading the help topic `Common Problems`.
W
3Portable Application
-Portable_Application
?Portable Application
 GSview can be installed as a Portable Application that can
 run directly from a USB memory stick or CD-ROM.
 To install as a portable application, obtain the GSview and Ghostscript
 self extracting archives and unpack them as follows:
  mkdir GSview
  cd GSview
  unzip gvNNNw32.exe
  unzip gsvNNw32.exe
  del set*.*
  del FILE_ID.DIZ
  del filelist.txt
  del fontlist.txt
  del un*.exe
 You should then have a directory structure as follows
  GSview/GSviewPortable.exe
  GSview/fonts
  GSview/gsN.NN
  GSview/gsview
  GSview/pstotext
 Run GSviewPortable.  This will automatically find ghostscript, 
 and will write the configuration file gsview32.ini into the 
 GSview/gsview directory.
 GSview as a portable application will not modify the registry.
E
WP
3Network Installation
-Network_Installation
?Network Installation
?User Profiles
 Install GSview to a network directory.

 When a user starts GSview for the first time, or starts GSview
 after the version number has changed, GSview will configure
 the local computer.

 Using a UNC path when installing GSview will not work
 from Windows 3.1, but does work from Windows 95.

W
 GSview tries to maintain one configuration file for each user.
 If user profiles are being used under Windows 95 or NT,
 GSview will store the INI file in the user profile directory,
 as specified in the registry.  If this can't be found,
 and the environment variable USERPROFILE is defined and is
 a directory, GSview will store the INI file in this directory.
 If this fails, GSview will store the INI file in the default
 location, the Windows directory.
 If the user profile directory exists, but is write protected,
 GSview will have trouble.

WP
 If you wish to stop GSview from displaying the `Easy Configure`
 when GSview is first run, or whenever GSview is upgraded,
 place an INI file in the GSview directory.
 `Remember to remove this file before upgrading GSview in the future.`
 This should contain only those entries that you wish to overwrite
 in the users configuration.
 The suggested technique is to install GSview, then configure it.
 Copy gsview32.ini or gvpm.ini from the system directory or your
 user profile directory to the GSview directory, then edit it to
 remove all entries except for:
  [GSview-5.0]
  Version=5.0
  GSversion=904
  Configured=1
  GhostscriptDLL=e:\gs\gs9.04\bin\gsdll32.dll
  GhostscriptInclude=e:\gs\gs9.04\lib;e:\gs\fonts
  GhostscriptOther=-dNOPLATFONTS -sFONTPATH="c:\psfonts"
 When a user starts GSview, their INI file will normally be used.
 The first time GSview is run, or when the GSview version doesn't
 match the INI file, the following will occur:

 1. The INI file in the GSview directory will be read, overriding
 the users INI file.

 2. The list of printers will be updated from printer.ini in
 the GSview directory.

 3. File associations (.ps, .eps, .pdf) will NOT be made or changed.
 If you wish to change these you must use `Options` | `Advanced Configure`.

 4. Program Manager groups / Start menu items / Program objects
 will NOT be changed.
 If you wish to change these you must use `Options` | `Advanced Configure`.
W

 If you are installing on Windows NT4/2000, and you select "All Users",
 then the installer will write this gsview32.ini into your GSview
 directory.  You must have installed Ghostscript first.

 If a user tries to use the GSview uninstall program, it will
 try to delete the GSview and Ghostscript files on the network.
 Make sure the GSview and Ghostscript directories are not writeable
 by users.
 To be extra safe, you may wish to remove the file `uninstal.txt` from
 the GSview directory.

 Alternatively, if you want install GSview on each computer without
 any prompting, unzip the self extracting archive then run the setup
 program as follows:
  setup -name "Your Name" -number XXXXX-XXXXX "c:\ghostgum"

 A silent uninstall can be done using:
  "C:\Program Files\Ghostgum\gsview\uninstgs.exe" "C:\Program Files\Ghostgum\gsview\uninstal.txt" -q

?Registry
 If you used the GSview setup.exe program and answered `yes` to
 all the questions, the following configuration has already occurred.
 If you didn't update the registry during GSview installation,
 the following information explains how to do it manually.

 For Windows 95 and later, the configuration is made using Windows
 Explorer.

 Start `Windows Explorer`.  Select `View `| `Options `.  Select the
 `File Types` tab.  Select the `New Type` button.
 Enter the following fields:
  Description of type = PostScript
  Associated Extension = PS EPS
 Press the `New` button, then enter

2Document Structuring Conventions
-DSC
?Document Structuring Conventions
?DSC
?Encapsulated PostScript
?EPSF
?EPS
 Adobe has defined a set of extended comment conventions that provide
 additional information about the page structure and resource
 requirements of a PostScript file.
 If a file contains these Document Structuring Convention (DSC) comments,
 GSview can display pages in random order using `Goto Page` and display pages
 in reverse order using `Previous Page`.  Selected pages can be extracted to
 another file or printed.

 If a file does not contain DSC comments, GSview can only
 display the pages in the original order.

 DSC conforming files start with the comment line:
  %!PS-Adobe-3.0
 where the number 3.0 may change and is the DSC version number.
 Some programs write PostScript files with a control-D as the first
 character of the file, followed by the comment line mentioned above.
 GSview will correctly report that these files are not DSC conforming,
 but will still display them with page selection features available.
 Complain to the author of the program that produced the PostScript file.
 To make the file DSC conforming, edit it to remove the control-D character.

 DSC conforming files contain lines such as:
  %%Pages: 24
  %%Page: 1 1
 These lines tell GSview how many pages a document contains and
 where they start.  GSview uses this information to select
 individual pages.

 Encapsulated PostScript Files (EPSF) are single page documents
 that contain a subset of the `DSC` comments and PostScript commands.
 EPS files start with the comment line:
  %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
 EPS files are commonly used for inclusion in other documents and
 for this reason require the bounding box comment:
   %%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury
 where llx, lly, urx and ury are integers giving the x and y co-ordinates
 of the lower left and upper right corners of a bounding box which encloses
 all marks made on the page.

 Some EPS files contain a preview of the PostScript document.
 This preview can be a Windows Metafile, a TIFF file, or an Interchange
 preview (EPSI format).
 For the Windows Metafile or TIFF file preview, the EPS file under DOS
 contains a binary header which specifies the location and lengths of
 the preview and PostScript language sections of the EPS file.
 For the Interchange format, the preview is contained in DSC comments
 starting with
  %%BeginPreview: width height depth lines
 An EPS file with a preview can be created from an EPS file without a
 preview using `Add EPS Preview`.

 GSview may give warnings when documents contain incorrect DSC
 comments.  This can be changed with `Options` | `DSC Warnings`.
2Portable Document Format
-PDF
?Portable Document Format
?PDF
?pdf2ps
?ps2pdf
 GSview can display and print PDF files, although there are a number
 of limitations with the current method.

 When displaying, GSview ignores the page size on the Media menu,
 and instead uses the /MediaBox from the PDF file.
 If `Options` | `EPS Clip` is enabled, GSview will use the /CropBox
 from the PDF file.

 GSview needs to `Open` a PDF file to count the pages.  If you
 `Select` the file, GSview will not be able to `Text Extract`,
 `Find`, `Goto Page` or do any other operation that needs to know
 how many pages are in the document.

 pdfmark link support is crude.

 To convert a PostScript file to a PDF file, use `File` | `Convert`,
 then select the `pdfwrite` device.

 To convert a PDF file to a PostScript file, use `File` | `Convert`,
 then select the `pswrite` device.

 `File` | `Extract` does not work for PDF files.
 Extracting PDF pages extracts PostScript rather than PDF.


 To batch convert multiple files, look at
X
 ps2pdf.
WP
 ps2pdf.bat and pdf2ps.bat
 in the Ghostscript directory.
 You will need to use
P
 gvpm.exe
W
 gswin32c.exe
WP
 instead of gs.exe.  You may also need to set the Ghostscript
 include path using `-I` or the environment variable `GS_LIB`.
E
2Opening a Document
-Open
?File
?Open
?Select File
?Save As
?Close
 The `Open` command on the `File` menu opens a file and displays
 the first page.

 If the file contains `DSC` comments, pages can be selected using
 `Next Page`, `Previous Page` and `Goto Page`.

 If the file does not contain `DSC` comments, `Previous Page` and `Goto Page`
 will not work.  Another file should not be selected until a last page of
 the file has been displayed.

 When a file is open, GSview will display the document filename,
 the current page (if available) and while the cursor is over
 the image, the location of the cursor in co-ordinates specified
 by `Options` | `Units`.  The co-ordinate can be PostScript points
 (1/72"), millimetres or inches.
 The cursor location is useful for calculating bounding boxes.

 The `Select File` command is similar to `Open` but it does not display
 the document.
 This command is useful for opening a document prior to printing it.

 The `Save As` command saves a copy of the current document.
 This is useful if GSview is being used as a PostScript viewer by
 another application and you wish to save the currently displayed file.

 The `Close` command closes the currently open document.
 This should be used before the current file is changed by another
 program.
 If you do not do this and GSview detects that the file length or date
 have changed, it will close Ghostscript and rescan the document.

 See also `Print`.
2Page Selection
-Page_Selection
?Page Selection
?Next Page
?Previous Page
?Redisplay
?Goto Page
?View
?Fit Window
?Full Screen
 `View` | `Next Page` or the `+` button moves to the next page of a
 document.
 This works even if the document does not contain `DSC` comments.

 `View` | `Previous Page` or the `-` button moves to the previous page.

 `View` | `Redisplay` or the `F5` key redisplays the current page.

 `View` | `Goto Page` or the `pointing hand` button shows a dialog box
 which allows selection of the next page number to display.
 The `Select Page` dialog box shows page labels since these are likely
 to be more useful than a sequential page number.

 `View` | `Next Page and Home` or the space bar moves to the top of the
 next page of a document.

 `View` | `Previous Page and Home` or the BackSpace key moves to the
 top of the previous page.

 The `Previous Page`, `Redisplay` and `Goto Page` commands work only if the
 document contains `DSC` comments.

 `View` | `Fit Window` or the `F6` key changes the display resolution
 to fit the entire page within the current window.  Repeated use
 causes either the width or height of the page to fit the current
 window.

 `View` | `Full Screen` or the `F4` key displays the page full screen
 (without title bar, scroll bars etc.).
 To return to normal display, press the Escape key.
2Document Information
-Document_Information
?Info
 A brief information area at the top of the window is used by
 GSview to display the document filename, the current page number
 and label (if available) and while the cursor is over the image, the
 location of the cursor (relative to the lower left corner of
 the paper) in co-ordinates specified by `Options` | `Units`.
 The cursor location is useful for calculating bounding boxes.

 The `Info` command on the `File `menu shows a dialog box with the
 following information about the `DSC` comments in the current document.

 `File `is the full pathname to the document.

 `Type` is` DSC`,` EPS`, `No DSC comments` or `Ignoring DSC Comments`.
 `EPS` is an Encapsulated PostScript File - a single page document
 that contains a subset of the `DSC` comments and PostScript commands.
 `EPS `files are commonly used for inclusion in other documents.
 `Ignoring DSC Comments` is displayed if `Options` | `Ignore DSC`
 is selected.
 These may be prefixed by `Ctrl-D followed by` or `PJL followed by`.
 Both of these indicate that the document does not comply with
 the DSC because there is some garbage at the beginning of the
 document.  To fix the former, see `Common Problems`.
 To fix the latter, do not use a HP LaserJet driver when creating
 PostScript documents for distribution to others.

 `Title` is a text title that can be used when printing banner
 pages and for routing or recognising documents.

 `Date` is the time the document was created.

 `BoundingBox` specifies a box that encloses all the marks painted
 on the page.  The four integer values are the co-ordinates of the
 lower left and upper right corners of the bounding box in default
 user co-ordinates (1/72 inch).

 `Orientation `is the default page orientation and is either
 `Portrait `or` Landscape`.  See the `Orientation` menu.

 `Page Order` is either `Ascending`, `Descending` or `Special`.
 If `Page Order` is `Descending`, GSview automatically reverses
 the pages when displaying or printing so they appear in
 ascending order.  When extracting or printing, GSview can
 be instructed to print pages in descending (reverse) order.
 `Special` means that pages should not be reordered.

 `Default Media` gives the media name followed by the width and
 height of that media in default user co-ordinates (1/72 inch).

 `Pages` is the total number of pages in the document.

 `Page` gives the page label and page number.

 `Bitmap `is the size of the display bitmap in pixels which may be
 useful if you are copying the displayed image to the clipboard.
W
2Printing
-Print
?Print
 The `Print` command on the `File `menu allows printing of the document
 using Ghostscript.  There are three methods used by GSview for
 printing: `Windows GDI printer`, `Ghostscript device`
 or `PostScript printer`.

 `Windows GDI printer` uses Ghostscript to create bitmaps for
 each page, and prints these using the standard Windows printer
 driver.  This is the slowest print method, but should work with
 most printers.

 `Ghostscript device` uses the Ghostscript printer drivers.
 This is faster, but you need Ghostscript to have a driver for
 your printer and you need to know what it is called.
 For example, the HP LaserJet 4 uses ljet4.
 See the Ghostscript documentation for more details.

 `PostScript printer` doesn't use Ghostscript for printing
 PostScript files.  Instead the file is sent directly to
 the printer.

 There is a significant amount of interaction between settings
 on the print dialog.  For example, selecting `Ghostscript device`
 disables the `Properties `button because this isn't relevant.
 More details are in the following topics.

 See also `Conversions` and `Convert`.
3Select Pages
-Select_Pages
?Select Pages
 When printing, a range of pages can be selected.
 Within this range, you can select all pages, odd pages or even pages.
 If you select odd pages in the range 10 to 20, the first to
 be printed will be 11.

 The `Select Pages` button may be disabled if it is not supported by
 the print method.

 The `Reverse` check box causes the pages to be printed in
 descending order.  This is enabled only if the document
 contains `DSC` comments.

 If you wish to print selected pages from a `DSC` document that
 has special page ordering (i.e. the pages can not be reordered),
 select `Windows GDI printer` and `Ignore DSC`.
3Windows GDI printer
-Windows_GDI_printer
?Windows GDI printer
 This uses Ghostscript to create a bitmap for each page, and
 these are printed using the standard Windows printer driver.
 This should work on all printers that support raster graphics.

 By default, a monochrome bitmap is used for maximum speed.
 If you want colour, you will need to enable this using
 the `Settings `button.

 To control how GSview handles requests by the PostScript or
 PDF documents to change the page size, see the
 `Page Size Matching` topic.

 `Options `is usually empty, but may contain Ghostscript command
 line options.  Use with care!

 This print method allows selected pages to be printed, even if
 a PostScript document does not contain `DSC` comments.  It does
 this by rendering all pages, but only sending the requested ones
 to the printer.  This may be very slow.
3Ghostscript device
-Ghostscript_device
?Ghostscript device
?uniprint
 The `Select Ghostscript Device` dialog box allows selection of
 the Ghostscript printer device and resolution.
 The default list of available devices and resolutions is stored
 in the [Devices] section of gsview32.ini and is taken from the
 standard distribution version of Ghostscript 6.0.
 You can use other devices or resolutions.

 To control how GSview handles requests by the PostScript or
 PDF documents to change the page size, see the
 `Page Size Matching` topic.

 Some Ghostscript options may be added using either the` Options`
 field or the `Properties` button.

 The `uniprint` button selects the uniprint device and displays a list
 of available configuration files (*.upp) for the uniprint device.
 If you select one of these configuration files, the configuration file
 name will be placed in the `Options `field of the Printer Setup.
 See the Ghostscript file `Devices.htm` for details of how to configure
 the uniprint device.
3PostScript printer
-PostScript_printer
?PostScript printer
 If `PostScript Printer` is selected, the selected pages will be
 sent direct to the printer queue, without using Ghostscript.
 This is similar to `File `| `Print File`, except that you can specify
 which pages to print.

 When a PostScript printer is connected via a serial port, it sometimes
 requires a Ctrl+D character to be sent after the PostScript file,
 and depending on how well behaved other programs are, sometimes before.
 This is part of the serial communications protocol used by these
 printers - it is not part of PostScript.
 The `Settings `dialog allows you can choose to
 send Ctrl+D before and/or after the PostScript file.

 Some PostScript printers understand multiple languages, and
 require a prolog to enable the PostScript mode.
 For example, HP LaserJet printers (with the PostScript option)
 require the following prolog
  ^[%-12345X@PJL JOB
  @PJL ENTER LANGUAGE = POSTSCRIPT
 and the following epilog
  ^[%-12345X@PJL EOJ
  ^[%12345X
 The prolog and epilog files allow you to send a file to the
 printer before and after the PostScript file.

 Another use of the prolog might be to invoke duplex printing
  << /Duplex true /Tumble false >> setpagedevice

 If the document is `PDF`, Ghostscript will be used to convert
 the document to PostScript which will then be sent to the printer.
3Print File
-Print_File
?Print File
 `File | Print File` sends a file to a local port, bypassing the
 Windows printer drivers.
 This is useful for sending a document to a PostScript printer,
 or for sending an output file produced by Ghostscript to a printer.

 The `Print` command on the `File `menu allows printing of the document
 using Ghostscript.
 The `Print` command is also used for creating bitmap files and
 `PDF` files.
 A `Printer Setup` dialog box allows selection of
 the Ghostscript printer driver and resolution, the page range
 and the
P
 `Spooler` output.
X
 program for queuing print jobs.
E

 All pages, individual pages or any combination may be printed.
 The `All`, `Odd` and `Even` buttons provide quick selection of pages.
 If a single contiguous block of pages is marked, the `Odd` and `Even`
 buttons will select odd or even pages within this range.
 The `Reverse` check box causes the pages to be printed in
 descending order.

P
 The `os2prn` printer driver uses the OS/2 printer drivers
 and should work with any printer with raster capabilities.
 Printer resolution cannot be selected from within GSview; use
 the Printer Object instead.  The printer default settings
 must match those expected by Ghostscript; printer page orientation
 must be Portrait, printer page size must match the Ghostscript page
 size.  Setting the property -dBitsPerPixel=1 should speed up
 printing a little.

 With all other printer drivers, Ghostscript sends the output direct
 to the printer queue.
 If you have trouble printing you may have to `Print To File`
 and then `Print File` or use the OS/2 command `COPY /B FILENAME PRN`.
PX

 If `PostScript Printer` is checked, the selected pages will be
 sent direct to the printer queue, without using Ghostscript.
 This is similar to `File | Print File`, except that you can specify
 which pages to print.  The `Advanced` button allows prolog and
 epilog files to be placed around the PostScript being sent to
 a PostScript printer.

 The list of available devices and resolutions is stored in the
 [Devices] section of
P
 gvpm.ini.
X
 ~/.gsview.ini
PX

 The default list of devices and resolutions is taken from the
 standard distribution version of Ghostscript 6.0 and may not
 be complete.

 To print a document without displaying it, open the document
 using `Select File`.

 If you want to produce a bitmap, some useful drivers are
 `bmpmono`, `bmp16`, `bmp16m` and `bmp256`.

 `File | Print File` sends a file to a local port

 This is useful for sending a document to a PostScript printer,
 or for sending an output file produced by Ghostscript to a printer.

 To control how GSview handles requests by the PostScript or
 PDF documents to change the page size, see the
 `Page Size Matching` topic.

 The `Options `field contains a Ghostscript command line option
 for the selected device.

 The `uniprint` button selects the uniprint device and displays a list
 of available configuration files (*.upp) for the uniprint device.
 If you select one of these configuration files, the configuration file
 name will be placed in the `Options `field of the Printer Setup.
 See the Ghostscript file `Devices.htm` for details of how to configure
 the uniprint device.

 The `Printer Setup` dialog box prompts you for the name of a printer
 queue to which output should be sent.
 This queue will be saved and will be the default selection next time.

3PostScript Printer
-PostScript_Printer2
?PostScript Printer
?Advanced
 When a PostScript printer is connected via a serial port, it sometimes
 requires a Ctrl+D character to be sent after the PostScript file,
 and depending on how well behaved other programs are, sometimes before.
 This is part of the serial communications protocol used by these
 printers - it is not part of PostScript.
 When using the `PostScript Printer `option, you can choose to
 send Ctrl+D before and/or after the PostScript file.

 Some PostScript printers understand multiple languages, and
 require a prolog to enable the PostScript mode.
 For example, HP LaserJet printers (with the PostScript option)
 require the following prolog
  ^[%-12345X@PJL JOB
  @PJL ENTER LANGUAGE = POSTSCRIPT
 and the following epilog
  ^[%-12345X@PJL EOJ
  ^[%12345X
 The prolog and epilog files allow you to send a file to the
 printer before and after the PostScript file.
E
3Properties
-Properties
?Properties
 The `Properties` button allows some Ghostcript devices to configure
 extra properties and a page offset to be specified.

 A page offset can be specified for each device.
 The page offset is useful for correcting a mismatch between the page
 origin of a Ghostscript printer device and a particular printer.
 Increasing the X value will translate the image towards the right.
 Increasing the Y value will usually translate the image downwards.

 `Properties` are typically used to set BitsPerPixel for a colour
 printer, or other types of colour or density correction,
 or PDF distiller parameters.

 `Properties` are specific to a particular device.  Changing
 the value of the `BitsPerPixel` property on one device does not
 change it for any other device.

 When you press the `OK` button in the `Properties` dialog
 box, the current settings are written to the
W
 gsview32.ini
P
 gvpm.ini
X
 ~/.gsview.ini
E

 file.

 Some `Properties` are predefined in GSview, but these may not
 match those available in Ghostscript.  The `Edit `and `New`
 buttons allow you to modify available `Properties` for that device.
 See the `Edit Properties` topic for more details.
4Edit Properties
-Edit_Properties
?Edit Properties
 Not every device supports the use of optional `Properties`.  To find
 out which devices support `Properties` and which `Properties` are
 recognised by each device, read the Ghostscript
 file Devices.htm or look at the Ghostscript source code.

 There are two ways to add or edit `Properties`.

 The first method uses the `Edit `or `New` button on the `Properties`
 dialog box.

 Each property must be either a number or a string.  Number properties
 are equivalent to the Ghostscript `-d` command line option.  String
 properties are equivalent to the Ghostscript `-s` command line option.
 Each property consists of a `Name` and `Value`.  These are used as
 `-dNAME=VALUE` or `-sNAME=VALUE`.
 The `Value` is chosen from the comma separated list of `Values`
 entered into the `Edit Properties` dialog box.  Spaces must not
 be embedded in the `Name` or `Values`.

 To delete a property, select it on the `Properties` dialog box,
 then press` Edit`, then press the `Delete` button on the `Edit Properties`
 dialog box.

 The second method is to manually edit the GSview INI file.

 For each device, you must add two sections to the
W
 gsview32.ini
P
 gvpm.ini
X
 ~/.gsview.ini
E
 file.
 The following example shows how to add property information
 for the cdjcolor driver.
 First add a section which gives the current values.
 This section, after the first character is removed, gives the options
 that will appear in the `Property` list box.
 The first character is `s` for string or `d` for number.
  [cdjcolor]
  dBitsPerPixel=24
  dDepletion=1
  dShingling=2
  dBlackCorrect=4

 Next add a section which gives the values to display in the
 `Value` list box.
  [cdjcolor values]
  dBitsPerPixel=1,3,8,16,24
  dDepletion=1,2,3
  dShingling=0,1,2
  dBlackCorrect=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
 GSview will also add the value `[Not defined]` to the listbox.

 When GSview prints a file, it will give Ghostscript the contents
 of the [cdjcolor] section of
W
 gsview32.ini
P
 gvpm.ini
X
 ~/.gsview.ini
E
 as follows:
  -dBitsPerPixel=24 -dDepletion=1 -dShingling=2 -dBlackCorrect=4
 If the value of a property is `[Not defined]`, that property will
 not be sent to Ghostscript.
3Page Size Matching
-Page_Size_Matching
?Page Size Matching
?Fixed Media
?Fixed Page Size
?Variable Page Size
?Shrinkg to fit Page Size
 If `Fixed Page Size` is selected (the default), GSview will use the
 page size on the Media menu and will ignore attempts by PostScript
 or PDF documents to change the page size.
 This is useful for PDF files that contain a mix of portrait and
 landscape pages.

 If `Shrink to fit Page Size` is selected, any page size selected
 by the document that is larger than the selected media will
 be shrunk to fit the page size on the Media menu.
 This is useful if you want to print an A4 sized page on
 letter paper (although a better idea is to buy A4 paper).

 If `Variable Page Size` GSview will set the default page
 size from the Media menu, but allow the page size to be changed.
2Conversions
-Conversions
?Conversions
 There are several ways to convert PostScript and PDF files.

 `File `| `Convert` uses Ghostscript to convert PostScript or
 PDF to bitmaps, PostScript or PDF.

 `File `| `Extract` allows a range of pages to be copied from
 a PostScript document.

 `File `| `PS to EPS` allows the bounding box to be updated and
 allows the header to be changed from PS to EPS.
 Read the documentation thoroughly before using this.

 `Edit `| `Add EPS Preview` adds a bitmap preview to an EPS
 file.

 `Edit `| `Extract EPS` extracts the PostScript or Preview
 from a DOS EPS file.

 `Edit `| `Convert to vector format` uses pstoedit to convert
 PostScript or PDF to an editable vector format.

 `Edit `| `Text Extract` uses pstotext to extract text from
 a PostScript or PDF document.
WP

 `Edit `| `Copy` copies the display bitmap to the clipboard.
 `Edit `| `Paste To` copies a clipboard DIB bitmap to a file.
 `Edit `| `Convert Bitmap` converts a clipboard DIB bitmap
 to a clipboard device dependent bitmap.

3File conversions and tricks
-File_conversions_and_tricks
?File Conversions
?Tricks
 Some common file conversions that can be performed
 using GSview and Ghostscript are:

 Convert PostScript to PDF.
 File | `Convert`, select pdfwrite, 300dpi,
 With Ghostscript 5.50, fonts with non-standard encodings
 will be included as bitmaps.  If you choose 72dpi, fonts
 will look rough.  Ghostscript 6.0 will embed fonts.

 Convert PDF to PostScript.
 File | `Convert`, select pswrite, 300dpi.

 Convert Level 2 PostScript to Level 1 PostScript.
 File | `Convert`, select psmono, 300dpi,
 Instead of 300dpi, you should use the resolution of your
 printer.

 Convert to a bitmap.
 File | `Convert`, select bmp16m, 72dpi.

WP
 Convert to an editable vector format (pstoedit).
 Edit | `Convert to vector format` OR convert to PDF
 using the method above.

E
 Extract text (pstotext).
 Edit | `Text Extract`

 Add a preview to an EPS file.
 Edit | `Add EPS Preview`.   See `Add EPS Preview` for
 more details.

 Remove preview from an EPS file.
 Edit | `Extract EPS` | PostScript

 Display with smooth edges.
 Media | `Display Settings`.  Set `Text Alpha` and
 `Graphics Alpha` to 4.  You need a display with
 at least 8 bits per pixel.
WP

 Save the displayed bitmap.
 Edit | `Copy` to copy to the clipboard.
 To save to a BMP file, use Edit | `Copy` then `Paste To`...
E

 Create a bitmap with smooth edges (anti-aliasing).
WP
 1. Display with smooth edges and save the display bitmap.
 OR
 2.
E
 `Convert` using a bitmap device and set the following
 in the properties.
    -dTextAlphaBits=4 -dGraphicsAlphaBits=4
3Convert
-Convert
?Convert
 `File `| `Convert` uses Ghostscript to convert PostScript or PDF
 to bitmaps, PostScript or PDF.

 You need to select a Ghostscript output device and resolution.
 The default list of available devices and resolutions is stored
 in the [Convert] section of
W
 gsview32.ini
P
 gvpm.ini
X
 .gsview.ini
E
 and is taken from the standard distribution version of Ghostscript 6.01.
 You can use other devices or resolutions.

 Some Ghostscript options may be added using either the
 `Options `field or the `Properties` button.

 All pages, individual pages or any combination may be converted.
 The `All`, `Odd` and `Even` buttons provide quick selection of pages.
 If a single contiguous block of pages is marked, the `Odd` and `Even`
 buttons will select odd or even pages within this range.
 The `Reverse` check box causes the pages to be converted in
 descending order.

 To control how GSview handles requests by the PostScript or
 PDF documents to change the page size, see the
 `Page Size Matching` topic.

 See also `Conversions`.
3Extract
-Extract
?Extract
 `Extract` allows a range of pages to be copied from the current
 document to a new document.  For example, ten pages can be extracted
 from the middle of the current document and written to another file,
 which will later be sent to a printer.
 If you select `Reverse`, the extracted pages will be in descending
 order.

 See also `Conversions`.
3PS to EPS
-PS_to_EPS
?PS to EPS
?BoundingBox
 In general, it is not possible to convert a PostScript file to `EPS`.
 However, many single page PostScript files can be converted to `EPS`
 by changing the first line of the file to
  %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
 and then adding or fixing up the `%%BoundingBox` comment.

 EPS files are commonly used for inclusion in other documents and
 for this reason require the bounding box comment:
   %%BoundingBox: llx lly urx ury
 where llx, lly, urx and ury are integers giving the x and y co-ordinates
 of the lower left and upper right corners of a bounding box which encloses
 all marks made on the page.

 `When used incorrectly, the PS to EPS command can produce PostScript
 files with incorrect DSC comments.  Such a document will cause problems
 when you try to include it inside another document.`

 To convert a PostScript file to `EPS`, the original file `must` be
 a `single page` document.  If the document contains `DSC` comments
 and is multi page, extract the desired page with `File` | `Extract`.
 If the document does not contain `DSC` comments, you will need to
 edit the file by hand to extract the desired page.

 `EPS` documents `must not` use any of the following operators:
  banddevice   clear         cleardictstack  copypage
  erasepage    exitserver    framedevice     grestoreall
  initclip     initgraphics  initmatrix      quit
  renderbands  setglobal     setpagedevice   setpageparams
  setshared    startjob      letter          note
  legal        a3            a4              a5

 The following operators should be used with care:
  nulldevice   setgstate     sethalftone    setmatrix
  setscreen    settransfer   setcolortransfer

 It is `your` responsibility to make sure that the above requirements
 are met.

 To test if a document contains any of the above operators, select
 `Options` | `EPS Warn` and then `Open` the desired document.
 After the page has been displayed, `Close` the document and
 then display the Ghostscript messages with `File` | `Show Messages`.
 If any of the above operators have been used you should see lines like:
  Warning: EPS files must not use ...
 If you find these warnings then do `not` use `PS to EPS`.
 Remember to turn off `EPS Warn` afterwards.

 A document must be displayed before `PS to EPS` is used.

 For documents without `DSC` comments, `PS to EPS` allows a bounding
 box to be specified, then writes out an `EPS` file consisting of
 an `EPS` wrapper around the original document.

 For documents with `DSC` comments, `PS to EPS` will change the
 first line of the file to
  %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
 then allows the `%%BoundingBox` comment to be changed or added.

 For `EPS` documents, `PS to EPS` allows the `%%BoundingBox` comment to
 be changed.

 `PS to EPS` does not clip the document to the `%%BoundingBox`.
 To do so would require changing the PostScript code itself.
 `PS to EPS` only changes the `DSC` comments.

 If `Automatically calculate Bounding Box` is checked, GSview
 will calculate the bounding box from the non white pixels.
 If unchecked, you get to choose the bounding box by clicking at
 the left, bottom, right and top.

 `PS to EPS` does not add a preview to a document.
 If you want a preview you add it with `Edit `| `Add EPS Preview` after
 first creating an `EPS` file with a correct `%%BoundingBox`.

 See also `Add EPS Preview`, `Extract`, `EPS Warn` and `Conversions`.
3EPS Preview
-EPS_Preview
?EPS Preview
?Add EPS Preview
?Extract EPS
?Preview
 `Add EPS Preview` takes a bitmap from the
 display and uses it to add a preview to an EPS file.
 `Add EPS Preview` can create a DOS EPS file with a
 Windows Metafile or TIFF preview, or an EPSI file with an Interchange preview.
 To use the `Add EPS Preview` command the following steps must be followed.

 1. Deselect `Options | Ignore DSC`

 2. Make sure the document has a correct bounding box.
 `Options` | `Show Bounding Box` is useful for checking the
 bounding box.
 A bounding box can be added or changed using `File` | `PS to EPS`.

 3. Select `Orientation` | `Portrait`.

 4. Select `Media `| `Display Settings` and set a suitable resolution
 for the preview.  If the resolution is too high
 it will make the EPS file excessively large.

 5. `Open` an EPS file that does not contain a preview.

 6.  Select `Edit `| `Add EPS Preview`, then the preview format,
 then the new EPS filename.  GSview will write a new file containing
 the original PostScript EPS file and a preview created from the
 display bitmap.
 The available preview formats are `Interchange`,
 `TIFF 4`, `TIFF 6 uncompressed`, `TIFF 6 packbits` and `Windows Metafile`.
 If adding an Interchange preview, the document must have an `%%EndComments`
 line, otherwise GSview may put the preview in the wrong place.
 An interchange preview is always monochrome.
 A TIFF 4 preview is a Baseline Bilevel Image (1 bit/pixel) with
 no compression as described in the TIFF 6.0 memorandum, but avoiding
 tags which are not described in the TIFF 4 specification.
 WordPerfect 5.1 requires a TIFF 4 preview.
 A TIFF 6 preview is a Baseline Bilevel Image,
 or a Baseline Palette-colour Image (4 or 8 bits/pixel)
 or a Baseline RGB Full Colour Image (24 bits/pixel)
 according to the TIFF 6.0 specification.
 TIFF 6 previews are either uncompressed or compressed with packbits.
 A Windows Metafile preview contains an uncompressed bitmap.

 7.
 Reset `Orientation` | `Portrait`, and
 `Media `| `Display Settings` to their previous values.

 To extract the PostScript or Preview section from a DOS EPS
 file, use `File` | `Select File` followed by `Edit `| `Extract EPS`
 then `PostScript` or `Preview`.

 See also `PS to EPS`.
3User Supplied Preview
-User_Supplied_Preview
?User Supplied Preview
 The `Edit `| `Add EPS Preview` | `User Supplied Preview` command
 allows an existing TIFF or WMF file to be added to an EPS file
 to create a DOS EPS file.
 This is useful if an application can export to an EPS file and to
 a WMF file, but cannot create a DOS EPS file with a WMF preview.
 The EPS file `must` contain a bounding box that corresponds with
 the TIFF or WMF preview file.
 It is not necessary to display the EPS file. `User Supplied Preview`
 can be used after an EPS file has been opened with `Select File`.

 You can add a preview that has no resemblance to the PostScript,
 which is most undesirable.
WP
3Convert to vector format
-PStoEdit
?Convert to vector format
?PStoEdit
 You can convert a PostScript or PDF file to an editable vector
 format using `pstoedit` by Wolfgang Glunz.
 `pstoedit` is licensed with the GNU Public Licence and is not
 included with GSview.  You will need to download it separately
 from the pstoedit homepage
  http://www.pstoedit.net/pstoedit
 or from
  http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/gsview/pstoedit.htm

 To use `pstoedit` from within GSview, use
 `Edit | Convert to vector format`.
 Three dialog boxes will be shown.

 The first dialog is for pstoedit settings.

 Select an output `Format`.

 `Draw text as polygons` should be selected if the PostScript file
 contains text and the output format does not support this, e.g. gnuplot.
 This might produce a large output file.

 When `Map to ISO-Latin1` is selected, pstoedit maps all character codes
 to the ones defined by the ISO-Latin1 encoding, which is used by
 HTML and MS-Windows.  This is the default.
 If you uncheck this item, the encoding from the input PostScript
 is passed unchanged to the output.

 If the output format does not support curves in the way PostScript
 does, all curves are approximated by lines. The `Flatness` option
 is used to control this approximation. This parameter is directly
 converted to a PostScript setflat command. Small values produce
 a more accurate approximation, but more line segments.

 Sometimes fonts embedded in a PostScript program do not have a
 fontname. For example, this happens in PostScript files generated
 by dvips. In such a case pstoedit uses a replacement font.
 The default for this is Courier.  Another font can be specified
 using the `Default Font` option.
 Some alternative font names are Courier, Helvetica and Times-Roman.

 Some of the output formats support extra options.  See the pstoedit
 manual for more details.  For example, the java output format
 uses `Driver Options` to specify the name of the java class.

 The second dialog (omitted if no page numbering is available)
 specifies the page to be converted, or if supported by the output
 format, a range of pages to be converted.

 The third dialog specifies the output file name.

 Not all `pstoedit` formats support bitmap graphics.
 If you need bitmap output, see `File conversions and tricks`.

 For more details please read the pstoedit manual.

3Text Extract and Find
-Text_Extract_and_Find
?Text Extract and Find
?Text
?Text Extract
?Search
?Find
?Find Next
 In general, extracting text from a PostScript document is not a
 trivial operation.  Words may be broken.  Text may be encoded.
 Ligatures may be used (e.g. replacing 'fi' with a single character).
 There may be no relationship between the location of a word in
 the PostScript file and its location on the page.
 Success in extracting text from a PostScript document depends
 greatly on the document itself.

 GSview has two methods of extracting text from a PostScript file.

 The quick method extracts all text from PostScript strings.

 The second method uses pstotext and Ghostscript to more accurately
 extract text from a PostScript document.

 The method used is selected by `Options` | `PStoText`.
 See the appropriate topic below:

 See also `Conversions`.
4Quick Text Extract and Find
-Quick_Text_Extract_and_Find
?Quick Text Extract and Find
 It is common for PostScript documents to contain text in the
 same order as it appears on the page, and for it to be given in
 PostScript strings, surrounded by parentheses.  Complete lines
 may be given in one string, or one word per string.  For this sort
 of document, extracting text can be done with reasonable success.

 `Edit `| `Text Extract` will extract text contained in strings from
 specified pages and write it to a text file.
 Line breaks in this text file correspond to lines in the document.
 Spaces in the text file correspond to spaces within strings, or to
 separate strings.  A more effective method of extracting text is to
 use ps2ascii.ps supplied with Ghostscript, or to use the `PStoText`
 program listed on the Ghostscript `WWW` page.  `PStoText` can be
 used from GSview by using `Options` | `PStoText`.

 `Edit `| `Find` will search for text and display the first
 page that contains the text.  `Find` asks for a search text
 and a range of pages in which to search.
 The preceding comments about extracting text from a PostScript
 document should be noted.  `Find` first extracts text from
 the document, then searches it ignoring all spaces in both the
 document and the search text.  Case is ignored when searching.
 Consequently the search text `these` would match both `These`
 and `The serial`.  No information is given about where the word
 is located on a given page because this information is not
 available without a complete PostScript interpreter.
 `Find` will not work for non DSC documents or DSC documents with
 special page order.

 `Edit `| `Find Next` will continue the search from the next page.
4PStoText Text Extract and Find
-PStoText_Text_Extract_and_Find
?PStoText Text Extract and Find
 This method uses pstotext and Ghostscript to extract text from
 a PostScript document.  Before doing any text extraction or
 searching, the entire PostScript document will be processed by
 Ghostscript and pstotext to produce a text index file.
 This may take a long time.  Once this has finished, text extraction
 and searching should be quick.

 pstotext uses the ISO-Latin1 character set.  See the pstotext
 documentation for more details.
  http://www.research.digital.com/SRC/virtualpaper/pstotext.html

 `Orientation` must be set to match the text direction of the
 document.

 `Edit `| `Text Extract` will extract text from specified pages
 and write it to a text file.

 Words can be copied to the clipboard using` Edit` | `Copy`.

 `Edit `| `Find` will search for text and display the first
 page that contains the text.  `Find` asks for a search text
 and a range of pages in which to search.
 The search text is first broken up into words.  For each search word,
 a search is made to find a match anywhere within a document word.
 Searching for` frog` would find` frog`,` frogs` and` bullfrogs`.
 The wildcards '*' (zero or more characters) and '?' (any one character)
 are supported, but it doesn't make sense to use them at the beginning
 or end of a word.
 Wildcards do not extend beyond the word being searched.
 Multiple complete words may be specified, e.g.  `GSview is a`.
 If the search text is found, the page containing the text is displayed
 and the first word highlighted.
 `Find` will not work for non DSC documents or DSC documents with
 special page order.

 `Edit `| `Find Next` will continue the search.

 For most PostScript files you should use
 `Options` | `PStoText` | `Normal`.

 `Options` | `PStoText` | `Dvips Cork Encoding`
 is only relevant for PostScript files produced by
 dvips from TeX or LaTeX documents; it tells `pstotext` to use the
 Cork encoding rather than the old TeX text encoding. Unfortunately
 files produced by dvips don't distinguish which font encodings were
 used.

 The GSview window can be copied to the Clipboard as a bitmap
 by selecting `Copy` from the `Edit` menu.
 The bitmap will be a Device Independent Bitmap (DIB/BMP format).

 An alternative way to get a bitmap output from Ghostscript is
 to use one of the BMP drivers.  See `Print`.

 `Paste To` copies a Device Independent Bitmap from the Clipboard
 (if available) to a BMP file.

 `Convert Bitmap` converts between a Device Independent Bitmap and
 a Device Dependent Bitmap.
 If the clipboard contains a Device Independent Bitmap (BMP format),
 this is converted to a Device Dependent Bitmap and added to the clipboard.
 If the clipboard does not contain a colour palette, one is created
 from the Device Independent Bitmap and added to the clipboard.
 This option is present because some applications (notably Windows
 Paintbrush) won't recognise a Device Independent Bitmap in the clipboard.
P
 `Paste To` copies the currently displayed image (if available)
 to a BMP file.
X
 There are no clipboard operations implemented in the X11 GSview.

 `Save Image as BMP` will save the currently displayed page
 as a Windows bitmap.
E

 If `Text Extract` or `Find` are used on a document with `PStoText` enabled,
 GSview creates an index of the words in the document.  If any words are
 marked with the mouse,
WP
 `Copy` will copy these words to the clipboard instead
 of copying a bitmap.
X
 these will become the current X selection.
E
 Text cannot be marked until either `Text Extract`
 or `Find` has been used with `Options` | `PStoText` enabled.
2Measure
-Measure
?Measure
?Calculate Transformed Units
 Lengths can be measured using the cursor location displayed on
 the status bar, or with the `Edit |` `Measure` dialog box.

 This dialog box shows the start location, finish location,
 difference between these locations and the length and angle
 between these locations.
 The start location is set when you click the left mouse button.
 The default start location is the lower left corner of the page.
 The units can be pt, mm, inch, or custom.

 Custom units allows you to display coordinates as they appear
 in a PostScript file.
 Custom units are usually specified by starting with an identity
 matrix and then performing a series of transformations.
 If a PostScript file invokes landscape orientation using
  90 rotate
  0 -595 translate
 then to display the user coordinates you would enter
 the following in the Calculate Transformation dialog:
  Custom
  initmatrix
  90 rotate
  0 -595 translate
  invertmatrix
  Ok
 The Current Transformation Matrix (CTM) is shown in
 upper part of the dialog.  You can enter a CTM directly
 if you like maths.
 It is easier to enter values in the Custom edit fields below this,
 but these have no effect until one of the transform buttons
 (translate, rotate, scale) is selected.

 See also `Units`.
2Options
-Options
?Options
 The `Options` menu has the following selections:
3Easy Configure
-Easy_Configure
?Easy Configure
W
 Easy configure allows you to select which version of
 Ghostscript to use.  It is assumed that you have already installed
 GPL Ghostscript 7.04 or later.
 If you do not have Ghostscript installed, see the topic
 `Obtaining Ghostscript`.
 For more control over configuration of GSview, see
 `Advanced Configure`.

 Easy configure will set the correct paths for Ghostscript
 and copy some printer defaults to the INI file.
 It does not alter the registry or start menu.
P
 Easy configure starts a configuration wizard to select the
 Ghostscript version and file associations.
E
3Advanced Configure
-Advanced_Configure
?Advanced Configure
?Ghostscript DLL
?Ghostscript Include Path
?Ghostscript Options
X
 `Ghostscript Version` tells GSview which version of Ghostscript
 is being used.  5.50 should be entered as 550, 6.50 as 650.

 `Ghostscript EXE` tells GSview where to find Ghostscript.
 The default is `gs`.
WP
 `Ghostscript DLL` tells GSview where to find Ghostscript.
W
 The default for Win32 is
  c:\gs\gsN.NN\bin\gsdll32.dll
P
 The default for OS/2 is
  c:\gs\gsN.NN\bin\gsdll2.dll
E

 Enter the correct Ghostscript include path into the
 `Ghostscript Include Path` field.
 This include path must include the directories where the Ghostscript
 library files (gs_*.ps and Fontmap) and the Ghostscript fonts (*.pfb)
 are located. For example:
P
   c:\gs\gsN.NN\lib;c:\gs\fonts;c:\psfonts
W
   c:\gs\gsN.NN\lib;c:\gs\fonts
X
   /usr/share/ghostscript/6.0;/usr/share/ghostscript/fonts
 The default is blank.
E
 Do NOT put a `-I` before the include path.

 The `Ghostscript Options` field may be empty.
 If you wish to turn off the `Platform Fonts` feature under
 MS-Windows, put `-dNOPLATFONTS` in the `Ghostscript Options` field.
 If you wish to search for fonts not listed in Fontmap,
 add -sFONTPATH to this field.  For example
   -dNOPLATFONTS -sFONTPATH="c:\psfonts"

 If you do not get the `Ghostscript DLL` field correct, GSview will
 not be able to load Ghostscript.
 If you do not get the `Ghostscript Include Path` correct, Ghostscript
 will not initialise and will then unload.
W

 Selecting `Copy printer defaults` will update gsview32.ini from the
 file printer.ini.

 Selecting `Associate .ps files with GSview` will update the registry
 to associate PostScript files with GSview.

 Selecting `Associate .pdf files with GSview` will update the registry
 to associate Portable Document Format files with GSview.

 Selecting `Create Start Menu items` will add GSview to the start menu.

 There is no undo facility for the actions of these four checkboxes.
 The Associate and Start Menu actions are normally performed
 (with an undo facility) by the GSview setup program.
E

 See the `Installation` topic.
WP
3Sounds
-Sounds
?Sounds
 The `Sounds` option assigns sounds to various events.
 For each event the sound can be set to `None`, a `Speaker Beep` or
 a `Wave` file.

 You must have a sound driver loaded before using Wave files.
 Wave file sounds are not available under MS-Windows 3.0.

 The events are:

 `Output Page`: the PostScript showpage operator was executed.

 `No Page`: an invalid page was selected.
 For example, pressing `Prev` while on the first page of a document
 with `DSC` comments.

 `No Number`: a command required page numbering and the document did
 not have page numbering.
 For example, pressing `Goto Page` when viewing a document without
 `DSC` comments.

 `Not Open`:  a command required a document to be open and this was
 not the case.
 For example, pressing `Goto Page` when no document is open.

 `Error`: many types of errors.

 `Start`: GSview opened.

 `Exit`: GSview closed.

 `Busy`: busy at the moment, can't do what you asked.

 The defaults are for `No Page`, `Error` and `Busy` to be a
 `Speaker Beep` and all other events to be `None`.
E
3Units
-Units
?Units
 The `Units` option sets the units used to display the cursor location
 on the status bar.  Available units are PostScript points (`pt` = 1/72"),
 millimetres (`mm`) and inches (`in`).
 The default is `pt`.

 The resolution of the units can be increased by selecting
 `Units `| `Fine Resolution`.

 See also `Measure`.
3Language
-Language
?Language
?International
 GSview is available in English, Dutch, French, German, Greek,
 Italian and Spanish.
 To change the language use `Options` | `Language`.

 On Windows NT, all existing languages are available to be
 selected, independent of the regional settings.
 On other systems, the language availability depends on the
 selected regional settings, in particular the chosen locale
 or system code page.
3PStoText
-PStoText
?PStoText
 GSview has two methods of extracting and searching text.

 The `Quick Text Extract and Find` method does a simple extraction
 of PostScript strings.  This method is easily confused.
 This is selected by the menu item `PStoText` | `Disabled`.

 The `PStoText Text Extract and Find` method uses the external pstotext
 tool and Ghostscript to extract words and their co-ordinates.
 This method is more accurate, but there may be a long pause while
 pstotext and Ghostscript do the initial processing.
 After this, text extraction and searching should be quick.
 There are two modes of operation.  `Normal` should be used
 for most PostScript files.  `Dvips Cork Encoding` should be
 used if you have a PostScript file produced by dvips
 which uses Cork Encoding.

 The default is `Normal`.
3DSC Warnings
-DSC_Warnings
?DSC Warnings
 Some documents contain errors in the Document Structuring Conventions.
 The level of warnings provided by GSview can be set using
 `Options` | `DSC Warnings`.
 If set to` Off`, GSview will assume that the DSC comments are correct.
 `Errors` will notify you of errors in the DSC comments .
 `Warnings` will notify you of warnings and errors in the DSC comments.
 `All` will notify you of irregularities, warnings and errors in the
 DSC comments.  The default is `Warnings`.

 If you ask to be notified about errors and warnings, the DSC
 warning dialog box allows you to make the following choices:
 `OK` tells GSview to take a guess about what was probably meant
 (rather than what the DSC comment actually said),
 `Cancel` tells GSview to treat the DSC as being correct,
 `Ignore DSC ` tells GSview to ignore all DSC comments.

 If `DSC Warnings` is` Off`, GSview will assume `Cancel`.
 Documents with incorrect DSC comments will be likely to cause problems.
3Save Settings
-Save_Settings
?Save Settings
?Save Settings Now
?Save Settings on Exit
?Settings
?INI file
 The `Save Settings Now` option saves the GSview window position,
 window size, last used printer, last directory,
 all items on the `Options` menu and all items on the `Media` menu
 to the initialisation file
W
 gsview32.ini in the Windows system directory (or for Windows
 95 or NT 4 in the user profile directory if user profiles are
 being used).
P
 gvpm.ini in the OS/2 system directory.
X
 .gsview.ini in your home directory.
E
 GSview reads this file during startup.

 When the `Save Settings on Exit` option is checked, GSview will
 automatically save the above settings when you quit GSview.
3Safer
-Safer
?Safer
 When the `Safer` option is `checked`, GSview will give Ghostscript
 the `-dSAFER` flag, which disables the deletefile and renamefile operators,
 and the ability to open files in any mode other than read-only.
 This is the default.

 When the `Safer` option is `unchecked` Ghostscript can change
 files.
3Save Last Directory
-Save_Last_Directory
?Save Last Directory
 When the `Save Last Directory` option is `checked`, GSview will
 save the current directory when you quit GSview.  When GSview
 is started next, this will be made the current directory.
 This is the default.

 When `Save Last Directory` option is `unchecked`, the current
 directory when GSview is started will be the current directory
 of the program that started GSview.
3Button Bar
-Button_Bar
?Button Bar
?Magnify
 When the `Button Bar` option is `checked`, GSview will display
 a Button Bar
WX
 at the top
P
 down the left side
E
 of the window.  This is the default.
 The Button Bar contains the following items in order from
WX
 left to right:
P
 top to bottom:
E

W
 {bmlwd gvwopen.bmp}
E
 `File` | `Open`

W
 {bmlwd gvwprint.bmp}
E
 `File` | `Print`

W
 {bmlwd gvwinfo.bmp}
E
 `File` | `Info`

W
 {bmlwd gvwhelp.bmp}
E
 `Help` | `Contents`

W
 {bmlwd gvwgoto.bmp}
E
 `View` | `Goto Page`

W
 {bmlwd gvwprevs.bmp}
E
 `Go back 5 pages`

W
 {bmlwd gvwprev.bmp}
E
 `View` | `Previous Page`

W
 {bmlwd gvwnext.bmp}
E
 `View` | `Next Page`

W
 {bmlwd gvwnexts.bmp}
E
 `Go forward 5 pages`

W
 {bmlwd gvwback.bmp}
E
 `View` | `Go Back`

W
 {bmlwd gvwfwd.bmp}
E
 `View` | `Go Forward`

W
 {bmlwd gvwmagp.bmp}
E
 `Increase resolution by 1.2`

W
 {bmlwd gvwmagm.bmp}
E
 `Decrease resolution by 1/1.2`

W
 {bmlwd gvwfind.bmp}
E
 `Edit `| `Find`

W
 {bmlwd gvwfindn.bmp}
E
 `Edit `| `Find Next`

 If using the increase/decrease resolution buttons, `Auto Redisplay`
 should be set.  Instead of using these buttons the
 `Media `| `Display Settings` command can be used.
 When the `Button Bar` option is `unchecked`, GSview will not
 display the Button Bar.
WP
3Fit Window To Page
-Fit_Window_To_Page
?Fit Window To Page
 When the `Fit Window To Page` option is `checked`, changes to the page
 size or orientation will cause the window size to be enlarged or
 reduced to suit the page size.
 Whenever the window is resized, GSview will force it to be no larger
 than the page being displayed.

 Changes in the window size will only occur when the window is resized
 or the page size changed; it does not happen immediately after this
 option is changed.
 Fit Window To Page is ignored for a maximized window.

 If `Fit Window To Page` is `unchecked`, GSview will not resize the
 window and areas outside the page will be drawn in light grey.
 This is useful if you do not wish the window to shrink when looking
 at pages at low resolution.  This is the default.

 See also `View` | `Fit Window`.
E
3Auto Redisplay
-Auto_Redisplay
?Auto Redisplay
 When the `Auto Redisplay` option is `checked`, GSview will
 redisplay `DSC` documents when the `Orientation`, `Resolution`,
 `Depth` or `Media` are changed.
 This is the default.

 For `non-DSC documents`, if `Auto Redisplay` is `checked`,
 GSview will `restart at the first page`.

 If `Auto Redisplay` is `unchecked`, the `View` | `Redisplay` command
 must be used to redisplay a document after changing the
 `Orientation`, `Resolution`, `Depth` or `Media`.
3EPS Clip
-EPS_Clip
?EPS Clip
?PDF Crop
 When the `EPS Clip` option is `checked`, GSview will clip the
 display bitmap to the bounding box of an EPS file instead of using the
 page size specified on the `Media` menu.  This is useful when
 adding a bitmap preview to an EPS file.
 If a PDF file is being displayed, `EPS Clip` will cause the
 display to be clipped to the PDF crop box.

 If `EPS Clip` is `unchecked`, GSview will use the page size
 specified on the `Media` menu for EPS files.  This is the default.

 `EPS Clip` does not alter the original document, it only affects
 how much of the document is displayed by GSview.
 It does not affect printing.

 See also `Edit `| `Add EPS Preview`
3EPS Warn
-EPS_Warn
?EPS Warn
 When the `EPS Warn` option is `checked`, GSview will write a
 prolog to Ghostscript when each file is opened.  This prolog will
 produce warning messages in the `File `| `Show Messages`
 window if any PostScript operators that should not be used in `EPS`
 files are used.  An example warning message is:
  Warning: EPS files must not use /initgraphics
 `EPS Warn` is not infallible.  It is possible to access restricted
 operators without `EPS Warn` producing a warning.
 If you do get a warning, do NOT used `PS to EPS`.

 The default for `EPS Warn` is `unchecked`.

 See also `PS to EPS`.
3Ignore DSC
-Ignore_DSC
?Ignore DSC
 Some documents incorrectly claim to conform to the Adobe Document
 Structuring Conventions.  Attempting to display one of these bogus
 documents will probably leave GSview horribly confused and unable
 to display the document.  If `Ignore DSC` is `checked`, GSview
 will treat the document as if it does not contain DSC comments
 and will only display the pages in the original order.

 The default for `Ignore DSC` is `unchecked`.
3Show Bounding Box
-Show_Bounding_Box
?Show Bounding Box
 Selecting this option causes a dashed rectangle to drawn over
 the image, showing the location of the bounding box.
 This bounding box is only drawn on the display, and does not
 affect printer output.
 The bounding box will only be shown for `DSC` documents (non
 conforming documents don't have a bounding box).

 The default for `Show Bounding Box` is `unchecked`.
2Page Orientation
-Page_Orientation
?Auto Orientation
?Orientation
?Portrait
?Landscape
?Upside-down
?Seascape
?Swap Landscape
 The `Portrait`, `Landscape`, `Upside-down` and `Seascape`
 (reverse Landscape) commands on the `Orientation `Menu select
 the page orientation used by the display.
 `Landscape` implies a clockwise rotation of the paper by 90 degrees.
 `Seascape` implies an anti-clockwise rotation of the paper by 90 degrees.
 These orientation options only affect the display and do not affect
 the print commands.

 If the `Auto` command on the orientation menu is checked and
 a `DSC` page orientation comment is found (%%Orientation, 
 %%PageOrientation or %%ViewingOrientation), 
 the orientation will be selected automatically.

 When the `Swap Landscape` option is `checked`, GSview swaps the
 meaning of Landscape and Seascape.
 Most Landscape documents require a 90 clockwise rotation of
 the paper to view.
 However, there is no standard and some documents need to be rotated
 the other way.
 The `Swap Landscape` button allows GSview to automatically rotate the
 document the right way in response to the `%%Orientation` comment in the
 PostScript file.

 See also `Page Size` and `Display Settings`.
2Display Settings
-Display_Settings
?Display Settings
?Resolution
?Zoom Resolution
?Depth
?Alpha
?Anti-aliasing
?TextAlphaBits
?GraphicsAlphaBits
?Draw Method
 Some settings for display only can be set with `Media` | `Display Settings`.

 The `Resolution` field sets the display resolution in dots per inch.
 The default for a VGA display is 96 dots per inch.
 This can also be changed by the resolution changing buttons on
 the button bar.

 For DSC conforming files, pressing the right mouse button will
 `Zoom` into the page at what is usually printer resolution.
 Pressing the right mouse button a second time will zoom back out to
 normal display resolution.
 The `Zoom Resolution` field sets the zoom resolution in dots per inch.

 The `Depth` field sets the page bitmap depth in bits per pixels
 for the display.
 Default will select the highest depth supported by your display
 driver.  In general, you shouldn't set this higher than your
 actual display depth because doing so will use extra memory
 for the page bitmap but won't improve the display.

 The `Text Alpha` field sets anti-aliasing for fonts.  The default
 (use anti-aliasing) is 4 bits.  To disable anti-aliasing of fonts,
 use 1 bit.
W

 `IMPORTANT`: If you use `Text Alpha`, GSview will disable
 `Platform Fonts` by doing the equivalent of adding
   -dNOPLATFONTS
 to the `Options `| `Advanced Configure` Ghostscript Options field.
E

 The `Graphics Alpha` field sets anti-aliasing for graphics and
 also for text that is too large to fit in the font cache.

 Using anti-aliasing slows down drawing.
 Text and Graphics Alpha can only be used if your display depth is
 set to 8bits/pixel or higher.
P

 A number of buggy display drivers have been written for OS/2.
 Many of these have a non-functional GpiDrawBits() API.
 The default `Draw Method` is to use GpiDrawBits() for most
 displays, and a slower double buffering method using
 WinDrawBitmap for VGA (4bit/pixel) displays.

 If your display has problems drawing the bitmap (usually
 seen during scrolling) or a SYS3175 (memory access violation)
 occurs in the display driver, then try explicitly using the
 GpiDrawBits or WinDrawBitmap method.

 If you have bugs in your display driver, please complain to
 the company that wrote it.

 Another alternative is to install the video package made by SDD 
 (Scitech Display Doctor).

E
3Zoom
-Zoom
?Zoom
 To enlarge a displayed feature, position the cross-hair mouse pointer
 over the feature then press the right mouse button.
 The window will swap from normal display resolution to zoom
 resolution and the status line will have the word `Zoomed` appended to it.
 The zoomed feature will be in the centre of the window.
 To cancel `Zoom`, press the right mouse button again or select
 any command that redraws the page (e.g. `Redisplay`, `Next Page`).
 By default the zoom resolution is 300 dots per inch but this can
 be changed with `Media` | `Display Settings` dialog box.

 `Zoom` will only work for `DSC` conforming documents.

 To enlarge or shrink the entire page, use the `Resolution`
 on the `Media` | `Display Settings` dialog box, use the magnifying
 glass toolbar buttons.
2Page Size
-Media
?Page Size
?Media
?User Defined
?Rotate Media
 The `Media` menu also allows selection of page size.
 Available page sizes are:
  11x17          11   x 17   inch
  A0              840 x 1189 mm
  A1              594 x 840  mm
  A2              420 x 594  mm
  A3              297 x 420  mm
  A4              210 x 297  mm
  A5              148 x 210  mm
  B4              257 x 364  mm
  B5              182 x 257  mm
  Ledger         17   x 11   inch
  Letter          8.5 x 11   inch
  Legal           8.5 x 14   inch
  Note            8.5 x 11   inch

 A user defined size can be specified in PostScript points (1/72 inch)
 with the `User Defined` command.  A size of 480x360 points at 96 dpi
 will give an image size of 640x480 pixels.

 If a `DSC` media comment is found, such as
  %%DocumentPaperSizes: a4
  %%DocumentMedia: a4 595 842 80 white ( )
 the page type will be selected automatically.
 If the media specification is not one of the above page types,
 the `User Defined` size will be set.

 If `Rotate Media` is checked, the width and height of the page
 are exchanged.  The image drawn on the page is not rotated.
 This affects both display and printing.
 Selecting `A4` and `Rotate Media` is equivalent to selecting
 `User Defined` with a size of 842 x 595 pt.
 It is more common to use the settings on the `Orientation` menu
 than `Rotate Media`.

2Command line options
-Command_line_options
?Command line options
 GSview ignores the case of options:
 -p is the same as -P.  On Windows or OS/2, you can also
 use /p or /P.  In the samples below, replace `gsview` with
 `gsview32` on Windows and `gvpm` on OS/2.

 Usage:
  gsview [-d] [-t] [-f[DEVICE]] [-p[QUEUE]]
    [-mPAPERSIZE] [-oORIENTATION] [-rXDPIxYDPI]
    [-geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT[+XOFF+YOFF]] filename

 Options:

 `filename` To start GSview and display filename.ps:
  gsview filename.ps

 `-p` prints filename.ps using Ghostscript.
 This is similar to `File` | `Print`, except that you will
 not be prompted for a printer (it will use the printer most
 recently used by GSview, or the printer name you provide)
 and GSview will exit after printing has finished:
  gsview -p filename.ps

 `-f` converts a PostScript file (not PDF) filename.ps
 to a file using Ghostscript (`File` | `Convert`):
  gsview -f filename.ps

 `-m`PAPERSIZE sets the paper size.  Any of the predefined
 sizes on the media menu are valid.

 `-o`ORIENTATION sets the orientation and may be one of
 `auto`, `portrait`, `landscape`, `upsidedown` or `seascape`.

 `-r`XDPIxYDPI sets the display, convert or print resolution.

 To display a file with A4 paper, landscape orientation
 and 96dpi:
  gsview -ma4 -olandscape -r96x96 filename.ps

 `-d` Debug mode.
 In debug mode GSview will `not` remove its temporary files.
 This is to allow inspection of these files after GSview has finished.
 Debug mode also produces more verbose output for `File `| `Show Messages`.

 `-t` Multi-threading.  GSview by default runs multi-threaded,
 except for Windows 3.1/Win32s.
 To change this, use `-t` to toggle the threading mode, use `-t0` to select
 single-thread mode and `-t1` to select multi-thread mode.

 Windows supports a few additional command line options.

 `-a` runs as a `Portable Application`.

 `-s` spools a file directly to the printer, without using Ghostscript.
 GSview will exit when the file has been spooled.
 Some examples are:
  gsview -s filename.ps
  gsview -sLPT3: filename.ps
  gsview "-sHP DeskJet Portable" filename.ps

 `-e` uses DDE to open a file in an existing GSview, or if GSview
 is not already running, in a new window using.
  gsview -e filename

 `-x` uses DDE to tell an existing GSview to close.
  gsview -x

3Dynamic Data Exchange
-DDE
?Dynamic Data Exchange
?DDE
 GSview implements a DDE server, service="GSview and topic="GSview".
 The XTYP_EXECUTE commands that are recognised are:
  [FileOpen("filename")]
  [FileExit()]
  [NextPage()]
  [PrevPage()]
  [GoBack()]
  [GotoPage(5)]
  [ShowWindow(nCmdShow)]
  [Command("command line")]
 The [Command()] command only understands "filename" or "/P filename".

 Don't sent multiple commands together.  GSview won't complain,
 but the multithreaded asynchrononous execution within GSview
 means that the first command won't have been completed before
 the second command is received.  If you need to send multiple
 commands, send them separately with pauses inbetween.

 There are two command line options to cause GSview to send a DDE
 command to another copy of GSview.
 The /E command line option uses [Command("command line")][ShowWindow(1)].
 The /X command line option uses [FileExit()].

2Common Problems

?Common Problems
?Problems
WP
 `Problem:` Can't load Ghostscript DLL ...

 GSview requires the Ghostscript DLL
 (gsdll2.dll for OS/2, gsdll32.dll for Win32, gsdll63.dll for Win64).
 This error message usually occurs if you don't have Ghostscript,
 or if GSview can't find Ghostscript.

 From the GSview menu select `Options` | `Advanced Configure`
 and enter the correct `Ghostscript DLL` path. For example
P
  c:\gs\gsN.NN\bin\gsdll2.dll
W
  c:\gs\gsN.NN\bin\gsdll32.dll
WP

 This message also occurs if Ghostscript cannot find its
 initialisation files (e.g. gs_init.ps).  Set the
 `Ghostscript Include Path` correctly.

W
 If using Win32s, make sure you don't already have a copy of
 the Ghostscript DLL loaded by another copy of GSview.
 Only one copy of Ghostscript DLL can be loaded by Win32s at a time.

WP
 If you can't get GSview to run Ghostscript DLL correctly, make sure
 you can configure and run Ghostscript on its own.

 `Problem:` Ghostscript Messages window says
 `Can't find initialization file gs_init.ps`.

 Set the `Ghostscript Include Path` to point to the directory containing
 the correct gs_init.ps.

 `Problem:` Ghostscript Messages window says
 `gs: Interpreter revision (XXX) does not match gs_init.ps revision (YYY)`.

 Set the `Ghostscript Include Path` to point to the directory containing
 the correct gs_init.ps.
 Don't try to display a PostScript file in the directory of an old
 version of Ghostscript (which will cause the old gs_init.ps to be
 loaded irrespective of the `Ghostscript Include Path`).

 `Problem:` Ghostscript Messages window says
 `Wrong version of DLL found.  Found version XXX  Need version YYY`.

 GSview found the wrong Ghostscript DLL.  Install the required
 version of the Ghostscript DLL.  Make sure you have only one copy
 of the Ghostscript DLL on your system.

E
 `Problem:` GSview says that a multipage PostScript file produced
 by MS-Windows contains 0 pages and will only show the first page.

 This is because the document does not have correct DSC comments.
 From the Control Panel, select `Printers`, `Options...`, then in the
 `Print to` group box click on the `Printer` radio button.  You cannot
 use the `Print To` `Encapsulated PostScript File` for printing
 multipage files.  The correct method is to connect the printer
 to `FILE:`.
 In addition,
 from the Control Panel select `Printers`, `Options...`, `Advanced` and
 then check `Conform to Adobe Document Structuring Convention`.

 The DSC comment `%%Pages: 0` means that the document does not produce
 any pages.  That is, the PostScript `showpage` operator is not used.
 If you find a PostScript document that has multiple pages and contains
 the `%%Pages: 0` comment, change the first line from `%!PS-Adobe-` to `%!`.
 GSview will then ignore the DSC comments and allow you to view all
 pages, but only in the original order.  Complain to the author of the
 program that produced that PostScript file.

 Some PostScript printer drivers include code that is specific to
 a particular printer.  The PostScript output from these drivers may
 be unportable and may not display in GSview.  If you are having this
 problem, try using a reasonably generic PostScript driver such as
 `Apple LaserWriter II NT` for PostScript level 2 printers, or
 `Apple LaserWriter Plus` for PostScript level 1 printers.

 For Windows 95, open the printer properties then select the
 PostScript tab, then select PostScript Output Format =
 `PostScript (optimize for portability - ADSC)`.

 `Problem:` GSview says "Page ordering is Special..."

 Your document used the DSC comment `%%PageOrder: Special` which means
 that pages can not be reliably reordered.  This may prevent GSview
 from displaying pages in any order other than the original order.
 If you continue and reorder the pages, PostScript errors may occur.
 The only way to fix this is to regenerate the PostScript without
 special page ordering.

 By default, Windows 95 creates PostScript files which use special
 page ordering.  To disable this, open the printer properties then
 select the PostScript tab, then select PostScript Output Format =
 `PostScript (optimize for portability - ADSC)`.

 `Problem:` PostScript files produced by MS-Windows start with a Control-D.

 For Windows 3.1:

 Since this occurs even when the PostScript printer
 `Conform to Document Structuring Convention`
 checkbox is checked, this must be considered a
 bug in the MS-Windows PostScript printer driver.
 The bug fix is documented in the MS-Windows PRINTERS.WRI file.
 Edit the win.ini file and search for the PostScript printer section.
 There may be more than one.  In each of these sections add
 `CTRLD=0` as shown below.

  [Apple LaserWriter II NT,FILE]
  CTRLD=0

 For Windows 95:

 The PostScript printer driver setup has an option
 (Properties, PostScript, Advanced) for suppressing
 a ^D at the start of a document.
 Fortunately the default is do not send ^D before job.

 `Problem:` PostScript files produced by Word for Windows 6.0
 cause a "Missing %%Pages comment" message box.

 Congratulations.  You have just found a mistake in the DSC comments
 when Word included an EPS file.  Word should have surrounded the
 included EPS file with the lines
  %%BeginDocument: filename.eps
  %%EndDocument
 Because Word didn't do this, GSview can't tell how many pages
 are in the document and where they are located.

 Please complain to Microsoft.  There is a problem in the EPSIMP.FLT
 filter version 2.01 which Microsoft needs to fix.

 In the interim, you have two solutions:

 1. Select `Options` | `Ignore DSC`

 2. Edit the PostScript file to correct the DSC comments.
 Search the PostScript file for all lines containing
   %MSEPS Preamble
 From each of these lines, search forward for the start of the
 included EPS file which should start with a line like
  %!PS-Adobe-3.0 EPSF-3.0
 Above these lines add the line
  %%BeginDocument: AddedByHand

 Then search for all lines containing
  %MSEPS Trailer
 Above these lines add the line
  %%EndDocument

 GSview should then be able to display the file correctly.

 `Problem:` GSview doesn't recognise the DSC comments in files
 produced using the Adobe PostScript driver 4.10 for Windows 32-bit.

 Do not use Tagged binary communications protocol.
 Change this to "Printers | PostScript tab | Advanced... |
 Data format group box | ASCII data"

 `Problem:` Trying to open any file gives
  `Unrecoverable error: configurationerror in setpagedevice`
  Failed to open device or install ViewerPreProcess hook: returns -26
  Page size may have been too large or resolution too high.
  Resetting page size and resolution

 Either the problem described in the error message has occurred,
 in which case you should reduce the page size, resolution,
 depth or a combination of all three.
 Alternatively, you may have used `-dFIXEDMEDIA` in the Ghostscript
 environment variable GS_OPTIONS.  When using GSview, it is safest
 not to use GS_OPTIONS at all and to use `Options` |
 `Advanced Configure` | `Ghostscript Options` instead.

 `Problem:` GSview hangs or takes a very long time when displaying a file.

 Resolution may have been set too high or page size too large.
 Reduce the resolution to the default 96dpi using
 `Media `| `Display Settings`.
 Change the page size with the `Media` menu.

?Show Messages
 GSview uses Ghostscript to display or print PostScript files.
 `Show Messages` displays the console output from Ghostscript,
 and is most useful when a PostScript error occurs.
 You may need to scroll back to see the start of the error message.

 The text in the `Show Messages` window can be copied to the clipboard.
 If no text is selected, the entire text will be copied to the clipboard.
 If some text is highlighted, only that text will be copied to the
 clipboard.

WP
 GSview uses the GPL Ghostscript DLL to render PostScript files.

 gvwgs32.exe (Windows) and gvpgs.exe (OS/2) are GS DLL loaders for
 printing.  It would be possible to use them from the command line,
 but since they delete the files listed on the command line
 it would be safer to use gswin32.exe (Win32), gswin32c.exe
 (Win32 console) or gsos2.exe (OS/2).
