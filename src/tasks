Jobs to do and suggestions
==========================

Update interval

Win32 accelerators (VK_F1, VK_F3, VK_BACK) don't work 
while button has mouse capture.
Backspace and space don't work when cursor is over button bar.

View bitmap files with viewjpg/viewbmp/viewpcx

Fix /Orientation landscape/seascape values to be more consistent. 

Remember extracted text between uses.

Write to network printer without connection.

Provide some means for clearing all pages in OS/2 multiple 
selection list box.

OS/2 beeps madly when opening second gzipped file.

Change message "File '' does not exist" to something more meaningful,
and don't display it on shutdown.

Adobe PS 5.0.1 driver for NT 4.0 produces incorrect DSC comments 
(BeginResource without EndResource). This is fixed in Adobe PS 5.1
(GSview 2.9x should now handle this).

Some PDF 1.3 files give incorrect links.  Check GS 5.91.

Display 2 pages side by side (useful on 21" monitors).

Advanced Configure should allow you to specify the Ghostscript
version.

Stop print dialog from enabling collate.
Handle printers that don't support USEDEVMODECOPIES - may need
to open the printer HDC ourselves.

gsprint -twoup doesn't work for PDF, which calls setpagedevice
for every page.  Need to redefine pdf_showpage.

Ghostscript mswinpr2 always shows dialog when called from RedMon.
(see muir.htm - printer settings not available to system user).

X11 uniprint settings.

Add "current page" option to new print dialog.

Remember different printer names for different print methods.

Test pstoedit for OS/2.
Loads OK, but doesn't find gvpm.ini correctly.

With X11 a modal dialog can end up behind the main window.
Since the dialog is modal, you can't move the main window
to reveal the dialog.  Find a way to keep the dialog in front,
or bring it to the front when the parent is selected.

X11 PDF links not implemented.

"currentfile fileposition ==" gives an error in GSview.
When an error occurs, display page rendered at time of error.

gsprint with 8-bit colour.

Make GSview Print display the contents of the response file.

Disable the collate control if it becomes enabled.

Move less use media sizes to a sub menu "Other".
Leave A4, A3 and Letter on the main menu.

Windows 2000 indexing service.

X11 ideas from Jack.  Fit to window width, separate menu command/button.
Hand interface for dragging page instead of using scroll bars.

External PDF links.

Auto resize using %%PageMedia.  This should be added to gs_page_skip,
and probably only operate if Auto Orientation is enabled.

Redisplay after pstoedit.

Linux: WM_GSTEXTINDEX.

Hand tool for all platforms for pushing page around.

Ghostscript include files use AFPL.  Need to have dual GNU/AFPL. 

dscparse: add dsc_ref, dsc_unref, %%Copyright, %%Version, %%Extensions.

Unix "PS to EPS" fails if bounding box is not automatically calculated.

gsprint uses full page rather than printable area.  Using -dPDFFitPage
gives a result that is clipped at the margins.  It may be better to 
set the margsins using setpagedevice.
