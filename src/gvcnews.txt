---------------------------
Version 5.0 2012-01-17
---------------------------
All:
  Non-beta release.

X11:
  This code is temporarily removed, because it is being converted
  from gtk+-1.2 to gtk-+2.0 and is in a non-functioning state.


---------------------------
Version 4.91beta 2011-06-03
---------------------------
All:
  Default include path only needs Resource for versions of GS between
  8.10 and 8.63.  8.64 and later use compiled resources.

OS/2:
  Remove the nag screen from the OS/2 build, given that Ghostgum
  Software has little interest in maintaining the OS/2 build.

Win:
  pstoedit now works with GSviewPortable.exe.

  Uses compressed HTML help (.chm), instead of the older WinHelp,
  which is not preinstalled on Windows 7 and Vista.
  The translated help files have been edited, but may not be correct
  and help topics may not open correctly.
  Non ISO-Latin1 character set help files do not display the index
  correctly.
  Closing the help file or changing the language while the help file
  is open will cause the GSview program to close.

  On Win64, GS 9.01 and later use gsdll64.dll, while earlier versions
  use gsdll32.dll.  When looking or ghostscript, use these assumptions.

  On Windows Vista and XP, saving the registration number may 
  fail on some computers due to security settings.
  On other computers, the registration number will be saved to 
  the registry VirtualStore for that user.
  If GSview fails to write the registration number, it now runs
  gsvwrg32.exe or gsvwrg64.exe, which will ask for Administator 
  credentials.

  Now finds other languages on Win64.

  Installer adds Publisher and Help URL to the uninstall data.


---------------------------
Version 4.9 2007-11-18
---------------------------
All:
  Prevent crash when incorrectly trying to convert PDF to EPS.
  Prevent mangling of non-ASCII paths when creating temporary files.
  When adding a %%BoundingBox line, use the same line ending as
  the preceeding line.

Win:
  Win64 will now print to "Windows GDI printer".
  Add StartPagePrinter/EndPagePrinter to raw printing routine
  as per updated Microsoft documentation.
  Change zlib DLL to version 1.2.3 due to security vulnerabilities in
  earlier versions.
  Change bzip2 DLL to version 1.0.4.
  Can run as a portable application for Win32.  See online help
  on "Portable Application".

OS/2:
  Remove the old zlib DLL.  Ghostgum Software no longer has easy
  access to OS/2, and this may be the last OS/2 build of GSview.

---------------------------
Version 4.8 2006-02-25
---------------------------

All:
  Save As dialog now defaults to using the currently open filename.

Win:
  Added -option to gsprint so that options can be forced to be
  before filenames.  Unknown options that are not filenames
  are placed before the "-c << >> setpagedevice -f".

  Fix multi display code to use the current settings,
  not the registry settings which are sometimes corrupted
  on Windows 98.
  If the saved window location isn't on a current display,
  reset the window origin.

  Make installer read filelist.txt from the installer directory, 
  to avoid being confused with one in the current directory.

  Win64 version will now print and convert.  It was trying execute
  the wrong file, and the right file had incorrect structure packing.

X11:
  Add redisplay if document changed and GSview window gains focus.

---------------------------
Version 4.7 2005-03-26
---------------------------
Win:
  Create 64-bit distribution.

  Updated libbz2 and zlib DLLs to latest versions.

  Increase stack space to avoid stack overflow caused by TortoiseSVN.

---------------------------
Version 4.62beta 2005-03-01
---------------------------

All:
  Use %%ViewingOrientation if auto orientation is selected.
  Allow language set in global gsview.ini to change the language.
  Fix crash if length of filename near limit.

Win:
  Add gsprint -duplex_simplex option.  Don't set duplex field
  unless specifically requested.

  Allow 64-bit compilation with Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003
  and Windows Server 2003 DDK, or Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005
  beta.

X11:
  Fix some compiler warnings on 64-bit Linux, but it will only work 
  with GS if pointers have top 32-bits zero.  DisplayHandle
  needs to be changed from an integer to a string.

  Fixed page offset for displaying EPS with different orientations.
  This only works if using GS 8.15 or later.

---------------------------
Version 4.61beta 2004-11-27
---------------------------
Win:
  Add gsprint option -port for specifying the output port name.
  Change gsprint -duplex to -duplex_vertical and 
  add -duplex_horizontal.
  If printer name is unknown, give list of known printers.

  Fix multiple monitor operation.
  Make sure that main window is created on a current display.
  Centre dialogs on the display with the main window.
  Make full screen on the display with the main window.

  Allow compilation with MSVC 8.

X11:
  If bzip2 library doesn't include bzopen(), also try BZ2_bzopen().

All:
  Add a save after opening the display device, to prevent
  grestoreall from destroying the graphics state, leaving
  a blank page.
  This also prevents grestore without a preceeding gsave
  from doing the same thing.
  
  Use language header file with the correct code page,
  not the reference copy in the language directory.

  Allow the maximum user defined page size (before warning)
  to be changed with UserSizeWarn in the INI file.

  Modify the "Fixed Page Size" and "Shrink to fit page"
  code to work with recent versions of ghostscript,
  which now populate the input attributes directory
  with all known page sizes.  This is needed for 
  GS 8.14 and later.

  Remove the old epstool.  The later version 3 should be used instead.

---------------------------
Version 4.6 2004-01-11
---------------------------
All:
  Fix "Text Extract" for PDF files.  Changes in 4.31 to avoid some 
  local/global allocation problems in setpagedevice caused problems
  with text extraction.

  Allow '(' or ')' inside a filename, which was interfering with the
  SAFER code.

  Modified pstotext to recognise excessive space in ashow
  as separate words.

  Allow MacBinary files that don't have the resource fork
  padded to 128 bytes.

  If "%%BeginFeature: *PageSize name" is used and media was not specified 
  in the header and we know it by name, add it to the media list.

Win:
  When printing and converting, Page Offset and device properties
  are now saved again.  This was broken by the [] fix in 4.42 beta.

  Recognise multiple monitor configuration.  Centre dialog boxes
  on the first display.  Display full screen on the last display.

---------------------------
Version 4.5 2003-10-18
---------------------------
All:
  When PostScript code runs another file with an absolute path,
  permit ghostscript to read the file if it is in the same
  directory as the main file.

---------------------------
Version 4.42beta 2003-09-19
---------------------------
All:
  If adding an EPS preview and cancel is pressed at the "Save As" 
  dialog, clean up correctly to avoid the "file is locked" error.

  Ghostscript 8.11 can now be broken out of a tight interpreter
  loop by using the poll function.  This required some changes
  to GSview to ignore the error return when telling ghostscript
  to abort.

  Add the ghostscript Resource subdirectory to the ghostscript
  library path.

  Allow ghostscript to read files in the same directory as the
  file being opened, when the filename uses an absolute path.

Win:
  Find pstoedit using the registry on Windows.

  Use custom profile functions for reading printer details, 
  to allow embedded [] in a printer name for PostScript printer.

  Set the correct margins in gsprint, to allow EPSFitPage and
  PDFFitPage to work properly.

X11:
  Remove CR characters from Show Messages window.
  Add Ctrl+Q shortcut for File | Exit.

  Use the more portable putenv instead of setenv.

---------------------------
Version 4.41beta 2003-08-06
---------------------------
All:
  When printing, apply the user GS options before setting
  the page offset.  This prevents a fault caused by interaction
  with the security code in GS when the page offset was non-zero.

  When adding an EPS preview, initialise the output filename
  to empty before prompting the user.  Without this initialisation,
  NT4 failed to display the open file dialog.

Win:
  Find "GPL Ghostscript" as well as "GNU Ghostscript".

  When saving the registration number fails due to to
  insufficient privileges, tell the user that Administrator
  privileges are required.

X11:
  If the LANG environment variable is not set, don't crash.

  Allow progressive updates to be disabled by editing the 
  INI file value ProgressiveUpdate.  Disabled is 0, enabled for 
  local displays is 1 and enabled for all displays is 2.
  The default is 2 (enbabled).
  
  Modify image message queue handling to improve image updates
  on slow displays.  Ignore SYNC if followed by another SYNC
  or a PAGE in the queue.  Merge multiples update tiles together.  
  Ignore update tiles if followed by SYNC or PAGE in the queue.
  Allow SYNC and PAGE to lengthen the tile update time.

----------------------
Version 4.4 2003-04-04
----------------------
All:
  Translation updates.  Russian help file now complete.

  Avoid a crash when -mpapersize is unknown.
  The only papersizes available to -mpapersize are those
  defined in dscparse.h, not those defined by the GSview
  INI file which has not yet been read when the command
  line arguments are parsed.

Win:
  Added cygwin makefile.  gvwgs32, setup and uninstgs won't run
  because --output-def produces corrupt executable.

  Allow entry of long registration names.  If a registry error
  of "access denied" when saving details, explain that Administrator
  privileges are required.

  Setup program now uses the localised path for "C:\Program Files".

OS/2:
  Add Catalan translation to distribution.

----------------------------
Version 4.32 beta 2003-03-08
----------------------------
All:
  Added partial Russian translation from Oleg Bondar.

X11:
  Do not use UTF-8, which is not supported cleanly by gtk-+1.2 
  and older X servers.  Instead leave menus and strings in the
  local codepage.  If the LANG environment variable has .UTF-8
  set, remove it.

----------------------------
Version 4.31 beta 2003-02-10
----------------------------
All:
  Lines that were too long caused a crash when DSC Warnings set to All.

  When displaying user defined paper size, use the current units.
  Allow the unit type to be specified when entering the paper size.

  Write the version specific configuration to [GSview-N.N] to 
  allow multiple versions of GSview to co-exist.

  Fix opening of gzip or bzip2 compressed PDF files.  
  GSview wasn't passsing the correct temporary filename to
  Ghostscript, so the security code was preventing it being
  opened.

  Prevent lockup when ghostscript writes a very long error
  message without line breaks.

  Added Slovak language translation (no help file yet) from
  Juo Sitá.

  When converting or printing a PDF file, open without -dSAFER,
  then use .setsafe if needed.

  Prevent overflow of buffer when getting PDF links from 
  ghostscript.

  Use global allocation mode when setting security or page
  parameters, to avoid some local/global allocation problems
  in GS 7.04, 7.05 and 8.00.

Win:
  When printing all pages, allow printing of more than 9999 pages.

X11:
  Add space after -o on compiler command line.

  Now uses the "Reverse" check box when printing.
  
  Prevent lock up when adding a preview.

  Convert all language resources to UTF-8, which is required on RH8.

----------------------
Version 4.3 2002-04-30
----------------------
All:
  Rearrange source code to put common, Windows, OS/2 and Unix
  code in separate directories.  Move epstool into the src
  directory.  Rearrange source distribution to be in a 
  gsview-N.NN directory.

  If using GS 7.04 and SAFER, replace ViewerPreProcess which
  gets removed by .locksafe due to a bug in GS 7.04 only.

  Zoom correctly for PDF files with non-zero llx/lly in mediabox.
  This involved simplifying map_pt_to_pixel and transform_cursorpos
  to use the display offset, instead of looking for the bounding box.

  DSC parser would return incorrect section boundaries if
  the PJL header was more than two lines long.

  Handle DCS 2.0 files with the separations in a single file.
  This makes a DCS 2.0 file look like a multipage file instead
  of an EPS file with incorrect DSC comments.

  Skip over the DOS EPS preview correctly, without attempting to
  parse the binary preview for document headers.

  Added epstool command 'k' to create a bitmap from the EPS file,
  cropped to the bounding box.

  Avoiding showing negative percentage complete numbers when
  processing files bigger than 22Mbytes.

  Dutch updates.  The help file is now 62% complete.

Win:
  Keyboard entry in the goto page dialog now works when the page ordinal 
  does not match the label.  This wasn't working because it was searching 
  for an exact match in the list box, when it needed to find the first item 
  to start with the specified string.

  Compiles with Visual Studio .NET.

  Default install directory is now C:\Program Files\Ghostgum\

  Update zlib32.dll to version 1.1.4.

  Don't show "Download GS" dialog if "Easy Configure" is cancelled.

OS/2:
  Now opens files when current drive is root, and filename given
  on command line without drive or directory.

  Update zlib2.dll to version 1.1.4.

X11:
  Now imediately opens file on command line, instead of waiting until 
  you used any menu command.

----------------------
Version 4.2 2002-02-07
----------------------
All:
  Allow GSview to work in unsafe mode with GS <= 7.03.  
  This was broken by the security fixes of 4.12 beta.

  Language updates.

  Run ghostscript within a stopped context so that correct
  error handler is used.  If error is /VMerror, resend
  error outside the stopped so that GSview gets the return
  code, to allow it to recognise when the page size/resolution
  is set to large.  For all other errors, quit ghostscript.

  Need to set PermitFileWriting and PermitFileControl in
  addition to PermitFileReading, as a result of a last minute
  change to GS 7.04.

  If using GS 7.04, use "true setglobal" before setuserparams
  and .locksafe to avoid a bug.

  Allow custom page sizes that do not match the dsc known media
  or media menu to select "User Defined".  Broken in 4.03 beta.

OS/2:
  When at top/bottom of page, make PageUp/PageDown move to
  previous/next page.

---------------------------
Version 4.12beta 2002-01-24
---------------------------
All:
  The pdfmark prolog now accepts /Action /Goto.  Broken in 4.1.

  Printing or converting a PostScript file with Macintosh line
  endings caused GSview to spin.

  Some additions for proposed security fixes to Ghostscript.

  Added "/.LockSafetyParms true" when opening the display device.
  To allow the GSview to change from -dNODISPLAY to the display
  device, add -dNOSAFER to the initialisation options and
  call .locksafe immediately after the display device is selected.
  This allows the display device to be selected and prevents
  it being changed to another device that isn't safe.

  Add the document filename and temporary uncompressed filename
  to the files Ghostscript is permitted to read, to allow them
  to be accessed in safe mode.

  Allow SAFER to be used for pstotext.

  Removed old pdf2ps code which was removed in GS 5.50.

  Fixed page size and resolution reset when insufficient memory.
  This was broken when we changed to the display device, which
  returns e_VMerror not e_limitcheck for insufficient memory.

  Remove pstoedit from the GSview distribution.
  Originally pstoedit contained code only by Wolfgang Glunz
  who had given permission to include a binary version of 
  pstoedit in the GSview distribution.  pstoedit now includes
  a number of third party drivers which makes licensing difficult.
  GSview documentation has been updated to refer people to
  the URL where they can obtain pstoedit.

  Unload pstoedit on the same thread which loads it.  
  This generally means that pstoedit is not unloaded until
  GSview exits.  This is needed to avoid a problem with
  incompatible run time libraries between GSview and pstoedit
  on Linux.

  Allow DSC parser to cope with EOF before %%BeginData section ends.

  Added Swedish translation.

Win:
  Fixed "gsview /E filename".

  Installer no longer fails if installing for all users
  when Ghostscript is not already installed.

  Redisplay a modified file immediately when you activate GSview
  from the taskbar, instead of waiting until the next message to
  processed by the queue.

X11:
  When using the German language, some Spanish text would appear.

  Delete event handlers were passing the event by value not pointer.

  Unload pstoedit on main thread, to avoid crash in pthread exit code.

OS/2:
  Using Fit Window to Page with PDF files now resizes correctly,
  instead of shrinking to a midget window.

---------------------------
Version 4.1 2001-11-22
---------------------------
All:
  PDF links didn't work when EPS Clip, because crop box
  was stored in page bounding box, not document bounding box.

  When using "Fit Window" and PDF, use crop box not media box.

  PDF without CropBox but with EPS Clip should use PDF MediaBox,
  not the default media.

  PDF /GoBack now uses history, instead of always going to page-1;
  However Ghostscript 7.03 and earlier do not give us /GoBack, 
  so it still doesn't work.  This involved adding code to output 
  named destinations as "/Action << /Subtype /Named /N /GoBack >>" 
  and then having GSview remember the action "GoBack".
  We have submitted a patch for Ghostscript which will allow this
  to work.

  Added the ability to recognise URI links, but we don't take
  action on them yet.  Need to resolve security problems first.

  Don't clear last used files when upgrading.

  When adding or adjusting the bounding box in the header, 
  remove it from the trailer.

  When scanning a DOS EPS file, ignore all after end of PostScript
  section.  Previously it would read and mostly ignore the data, 
  but it would complain if a line was longer than 256 characters.

Windows:
  When printing, using "selection" then clicking on the ghostscript 
  device selection button would unselect all pages.  
  When selecting the Ghostscript device, do not call the page
  dialog procedure if the page list control does not exist.

  When fullscreen, use black for the uncovered area.

  Handle PDF links when fullscreen.

  When using GDI printing, use the offset from the GDI section
  of the INI file, not the bmp16m section.

OS/2:
  When fullscreen, use black for the uncovered area.

  Handle PDF links when fullscreen.

  Updated version of pstoedit.

X11:
  Allow the image window to be "pushed" with the cursor.

  Prevent button bar from taking the focus.
  Added keyboard scrolling of image window.
  Added missing keyboard accelerators.

---------------------------
Version 4.05beta 2001-10-20
---------------------------
All:
  DSC parser didn't initialise orientation field when adding a new page.
  Make sure DSC parser resets everything needed in CDSC structure.

  Add %%PageCropBox to DSC parser.  This is referenced in
  Adobe Technical Note #5644 which says it is in DSC 3.0,
  but it isn't.  It could be useful to Ghostscript for
  setting the PDF CropBox.  Recognise this in a page and
  also in the defaults section.  The latter shouldn't happen 
  because %%CropBox should be used instead.

  In page list box, use '1' if label matches ordinal, 
  or '1 "i"' if they don't.  This is to cope with documents
  that reuse the label or set every label to the same string.

  Changed description of "Properties" to refer to devices rather
  than printers, because it applies to both Convert and Print.

  Adjusted progressive drawing so that if the drawing to the
  screen is taking too much time, in addition to lengthening
  the time between updates, also increase the area required
  before an update occurs.  This provides a noticeable 
  improvement on old slow computers (486's still have a use
  in testing).

  Open icon changed to folder, not a document.

Windows:
  Windows 95 was still putting the INI file in the wrong place.

  Setup includes an empty gsview32.ini, to overwrite any 
  already in the gsview destination directory.
  This was created incorrectly, and instead of being empty
  contained "1 file(s) copied".  Harmless, but not correct.

OS/2:
  Show Messages dialog was not showing the text.
  When importing text to the MLE, the buffer size must be set 
  to the data length and not the actual buffer size.

X11:
  Print dialog crashed in 4.03 and 4.04.

  Can be built multithreaded on SGI IRIX 6.5, but not 6.2.
  When built multithreaded on IRIX, gdb can't debug it.

  The X11 INI file is .gsview.ini, not .gsviewrc.  Updated the
  documentation.

  Add tooltips to button bar.

  Fit to window now gets the correct size, but only because
  the scroll bar width and window border widths are hard
  coded into the calculation.

---------------------------
Version 4.04beta 2001-10-14
---------------------------
All:
  Printing and converting working again.  
  This was broken for DSC files when file method changed in 4.03 beta.

  Renamed C files from .cpp to .c to make it compile on 
  non C++ Unix compilers.

Windows:
  On Windows 95, read the initialisation file from the Windows
  directory, not the current directory.  Broken in 4.03 beta
  when platform independent code used for INI files.

  gsprint now allows spaces in filenames.

  gswgs32 does not destroy window if an error occurs.
  Probably broken since 3.61 beta.

X11:
  Set and remember the window position.
  Works on Linux, but will not accurately set/restore the position
  on other systems.
  -geometry now uses xoffset and yoffset.  

  Added support for pstoedit, now we need a libpstoedit.so.
  Initial build of libpstoedit.so will cause a segfault as GSview exits.

  Remove dependence on X11 include files.

  Don't poll during display_update if on single thread
  and image is locked, to avoid drawing from the image
  while it is being resized.

  Install now creates parent directories as needed.

  Updated spec file which also copies gsview.desktop and gsview.png.

---------------------------
Version 4.03beta 2001-10-06
---------------------------
All:
  Use language specific "All" in page list when page
  numbering not available.

  Rewrote command line argument parser.
  Added command line argument for
   /ma4   (page size)
   /oauto, /oportrait, /olandscape (orientation)
   /f[DEVICE] (convert to file, optional device)
   -geometry WIDTHxHEIGHT+XOFFSET+YOFFSET (initial window size and position)

  Add progressive drawing to window as Ghostscript renders, by
  dividing the image into tiles and keeping track of which tiles
  have been dirtied.  Update the window when sufficient tiles
  have been dirtied, or when one tile dirtied a lot and sufficient
  time (usually 100ms) has passed.  If drawing to the window is
  slow, increase the time between updates.

  Reading of document now uses GFile structure.  There are three 
  implementations, C files, Windows files and memory.

  Added conditionals to remove all methods to copy, save or print
  documents.

  Added %%HiResBoundingBox: and %%CropBox: to DSC parser.

  All files needed for Unix can now compile as plain C.
  This is necessary because the X11 include files on Solaris
  didn't contain valid function prototypes and so wouldn't
  compile with a C++ compiler, even inside extern "C" { }.

  When configuration changed, unload Ghostscript DLL.

  Handle the file being changed or deleted in the 
  redisplay command code.  Don't complain if the GS thread
  finds that the file has been deleted.

  Changed A0, A1, A2 sizes to be dynamically loaded from
  the INI file.  Additional sizes can be added by editing
  the UserMedia section of the INI file.  Eventually a user
  interface will be added for adding or removing custom sizes.

  Greek language updates.

OS/2:
  Fixes to Dutch setup resources.

Win:
  Redraw scroll bars when image size changes.

  Use platform independent code for writing INI files,
  because the Win32 version runs very slow on Win2k. 

X11:
  Add separate configuration for "Ghostscript Program" (gs) and
  "Ghostscript Shared Object" (libgs.so).  Printing now works.
  If you have used GSview before, you will need to update your
  configuration.

  -geometry ignores xoffset and yoffset.  
  How do you set these with Gtk+?

  Added Dutch translation of menus.

  Will compile on Solaris with a few changes to the makefile.

  Added 8 bit/pixel display using 96 colour palette.
  Removed 1 bit/pixel display because I can't find a gdk_draw_*()
  function to do it.

  Fixed ViewerPreProcess code to handle inverted PageOffset.
  Although PageOffset uses the same units as default user
  coordinates, the direction is according to device coordinates.  
  This was needed to fix zoom and epsf clip.

  Works single threaded.  Tested on SGI IRIX 6.2 and SunOS 5.7.

  Use getimeofday instead of ftime because it seems to be more
  portable.  SGI IRIX doesn't have ftime.

---------------------------
Version 4.02beta 2001-09-13
---------------------------
All:
  Correctly give DSC long line warning.
  Correctly handle DSC early trailer warning.

  Added new common problem.  GSview will take a long time to
  display a file at 700dpi.

  Added Dutch translation.  Help file not yet translated.

  Added A0, A1 and A2 paper sizes.

Win:
  Compile Greek setup resources using correct code page.

OS/2:
  Changed code page resources (except Greek) to 850.
  Change process and PM code page to match language
  resources, usually 850.
  Allow language to be selected if the code page is
  in the PM code page list.

---------------------------
Version 4.01beta 2001-08-04
---------------------------
All:
  Added Greek translation.

  Changed doc2html to write tags in lower case, convert
  non-ascii characters in links to &#nnn;
  Replace isspace() and allow a charset to be specified for Greek.

  Print all pages when "gsview /Ffile.pdf" is used and don't crash.

  When adding TIFF preview to make a DOS EPS file, use the correct
  size for the PostScript section.  Fix in previous version
  introduced this bug.

  Added doc2xml.cpp, htmsplit.cpp, xmlwin.xsl, xml2htm.xsl, xml2ipf.xsl,
  xml2rtf.xsl, xml2htmh.xsl, xml2hhc.xsl, xml2hhk.xsl, gsxml.dtd, test.hhp.  
  These files aren't finished.
  This is the first stage in converting the documentation into xml which 
  will then be used to generate HTML, RTF, IPF and Windows HTML Help.
  These are for use with XT by James Clark.
   http://www.jclark.com/xml/xt.html

  doc2html no longer crashes if given a link with a long name.

Win:
  Changed language loading code to search for DLLs named
  gsvw32??.dll in the GSview EXE directory.  Each DLL
  provides a bitmap of its name which is placed on the
  languages menu.  New languages can be now be added
  without having to modify the GSview executable.
  Code will only need to be added if a different
  character set is needed (e.g. Cyrillic).

  Changed code to allow compilation as UNICODE.
  It should be possible to link GSview with the Microsoft Layer 
  for Unicode to allow this to run on Windows 95.

  When using Windows NT and the code page of the resource
  doesn't match the code page of the system, load resources
  as Unicode and use the wide version of some APIs to make
  languages such as Greek display correctly, even if the
  system has never installed the Greek locale.

  Select Language dialog now uses bitmaps for the names
  of each language, so they appear correct without the
  language specific fonts.

  Language menu uses bitmaps if the name can't be drawn
  in the GSview language.  When the menu has the focus,
  the colours are drawn reversed for the bitmap.  This
  appears to be a bug in Windows 95 and NT.  Windows 3.1
  can do it correctly!  Reversing the black and white
  palette entries doesn't help - this make the selected
  menu item display correctly, but unselected it displays
  in reverse colours, that is the palette is being ignored.

  Changed doc2rtf to only ignore leading spaces for key names
  not white space.  White space included Greek accented characters.

  Changed uninstall to have silent option -q.

  Changed setup to allow registration details to be set.

  Disabled look up of system sounds, since they haven't been
  stored in win.ini since before Windows 95.

  Changed 'F' accelerator to "File | Convert".

  Change print page selection dialog for DSC files to use
  previous dialog with a list box which allows selecting 
  disjoint ranges of pages.

  Change GSview Print to display the contents of the
  options file when in debug mode.

OS/2:
  Changed 'F' accelerator to "File | Convert".

  Change GSview Print to display the contents of the
  options file when in debug mode.

  Greek language untested.  It will only be enabled if the
  system code page is set to 869.

X11:
  Greek language untested.

----------------------
Version 4.0 2001-06-02
----------------------
Win:
  Unload Ghostscript DLL before calling pstoedit.

  EPS previews fixed.  They were broken when we changed to 
  using the display device instead of mswindll.

OS/2:
  Text extraction with pstotext crashed when the extracted
  character was a null, because GSview did not pass the complete
  to pstotext.  Scan for EOL in the entire buffer, not just until
  a null character.

  Don't reset scroll bars when image closed, needed for zoom
  to work correctly.  Reset scroll bars when image closed 
  and no file selected.

X11:
  Help script prints usage info and can be called without tag.
  Added -help, -version and -geometry.

  Changed default install path to /usr/bin/gsview.

All:
  Ghostscript plus GSview takes 20 - 30Mbytes of disk space, not 10M.

  Text extracted using pstotext could use ^Z as a valid character
  (math formula from TeX).  Open files in binary not text mode.

  Fixed crash when PDF file without crop box, EPS Clip enabled and Fit Page
  used together.

  Fixed TIFF StripByteCount when image data < 8kbytes, and for multiple
  strip images fixed StripByteCount of last strip.

---------------------------
Version 3.62beta 2001-04-12
---------------------------
All:
  Use common code for loading DLL and display device.

  Fix printing/convert using GS 7.00.

  "Rescale to fit page" is now called "Shrink to fit page" since
  this is how it behaves.

X11:
  Use new Ghostscript shared object libgs.so.

---------------------------
Version 3.61beta 2001-04-07
---------------------------
All:
  Avoid trying to send trailer after document is deleted.

  Changed ftp locations to ftp://mirror.cs.wisc.edu/pub/mirrors/ghost/

  Removed "Options | Quick Open".  This isn't needed on modern
  fast computers, was not the default, and caused problems with
  many PostScript files.

  Fixed progress message "Drawing 50%".

  Remove quotes from Ghostscript Options when initialising DLL.

  Allow epstool to ignore DSC warnings with command line option -e.
  A comment will be added to the EPS file about the reckless user
  who ignored the DSC warning.

  Enabled anti-aliasing as the default. TextAlphaBits=4, 
  GraphicsAlphaBits=4.
 
Win32:
  If installing for "All User", write gsview32.ini file to
  gsview directory so GSview is auto-configured for any user.

  When first use after install contains filename on the command line,
  don't ignore it.

  Fixed page selection for File | Convert.

  Use new Ghostcript API.

  Change user messages to start at WM_USER+100, not WM_USER
  which caused problems on Japanese Windows.  
  Didn't change WM_GSV16SPL which is only used on Win32s
  and is used for interprocess communication.

OS/2:
  Use new Ghostscript API.

X11:
  Probably won't compile.  Need to use new Ghostscript API.

---------------------------
Version 3.6 2000-12-29
---------------------------
All:
  Skip over DOSEPS header correctly.

  When adding EPS preview, handle files without a trailer.

  Use correct orientation for last page of a PDF document.

  Tell Readme.htm that pstoedit.htm is in the current directory
  so it works when Readme.htm is placed on the web site.
  Place a refresh pstoedit.htm to redirect to ../pstoedit/pstoedit.htm
  for the GSview Win32 installation.  

  Added some of the more common distiller parameters to the
  pdfwrite properties in printer.ini.

  If using GS 6.50 or later and pdfwrite, use -c .setpdfwrite -f
  not -c save pop -f.

  pdfmark is broken in GS 6.50.  Unless you are writing to pdfwrite,
  Ghostscript won't process links.  Add -dWRITEPDFMARKS if GS >= 6.50.
  A patch is needed to GS 6.50 pdf_main.ps to add
   systemdict /WRITEPDFMARKS or
  as the last line of .writepdfmarks (line 35).

  Don't highlight links in PDF files if GS >= 6.50.  Ghostscript
  now does this itself.

Win32:
  Widened listboxes in property dialog.

  Zoom now centres correctly if scroll position not top left.

X11:
  Added AAGSMESSX11 message to resources.

  Made makefile less dependant on gnu make.

  Use putenv not setenv because it is more widely supported.

  Allow the help program to be configured using the INI file,
  but not from the user interface.  Default help command is 
  "gsview-help".  See the script gvxhelp.txt for implementation.

OS/2:
  Fixed position of "Fixed Media" listbox in Convert and
  Print dialogs.

---------------------------
Version 3.5 2000-12-16
---------------------------
All:
  German language updates from Tobias Burnus.

  PDF page orientation for page n was using the orientation of page n+1.

  Fixed initialisation problem with page[].viewing_orientation.

Win32:
  Prolog and Epilog fields didn't scroll.

  Don't give a registry error message if GSview registry key exists
  without GSview being registered.

  Added *.psz as an alternative to *.ps.gz as the default file extension.

OS/2:
  Change default path to c:\gs\gsview\gvpm.exe

  Added *.psz as an alternative to *.ps.gz as the default file extension.

X11:
  Change default draw method back to pixmap and added note in Readme.htm
  about bug #124957 in GSview 6.50.

---------------------------
Version 3.42beta 2000-12-08
---------------------------

All:
  DSC parser handles %%ViewerOrientation.
  DSC parser doesn't flag an error if %%Pages absent but on %%Page is found.
  DSC parser frees memory if initialisation fails.
  Added const qualifier to string constants.
  When updating the bounding box, correctly handle auto bounding box
  in conjunction with EPSF clip.
  
Win32:
  When printing, make the Pages range show the number of pages.

  Increase the printer output port name length from 32 bytes
  to 256 bytes.  It is the printer queue name that is limited
  to 32 bytes, not the output port name.

X11:
  Set the numeric locale to "C" so that floating point
  numbers writen to Ghostscript and the configuration 
  file use a period not a comma.

  Added dynamic loading of libz.so and libbz2.so for automatic
  decompression of gzip and bzip2 files.

  When printing, page selection was ignored and all pages were printed.
  When extracting pages, page 1 was always extracted.

  Now handles Ghostscript include directory correctly.

  Makefile now builds epstool and pstotext.

  get_filename() now changes directory to that of the selected file.

  Change initialisation file name to .gsview.ini
  Changed documentation location to /usr/local/doc/gsview-3.5/
  Change printer.ini location to /usr/local/etc/gsview/printer.ini
  Global initialisation file now /usr/local/etc/gsview/gsview.ini

  Change default draw method to backing pixmap, since pixmap method 
  is broken in GSview 6.50.

---------------------------
Version 3.41beta 2000-11-06
---------------------------
All:
  This is based on 3.32 with a few bug fixes.

  DSC parser didn't allow %%BeginData type or bytesorlines to
  be omitted.

  DSC parser updated to be compatible with Ghostscript.

  Fixed parsing of Ghostscript options which didn't process
  quotes correctly.

  When printing, "Fixed Media" has been replaced by a choice of
    Variable Page Size (don't restrict page size)
    Fixed Page Size (PageSize policy 5)
    Rescale to fit Page Size (PageSize policy 3)
  This doesn't work with Aladdin Ghostscript 6.01 and AFPL 
  Ghostscript 6.30 which do not adjust the page as required
  by policy 3.
  
Win32:
  Reverse page order was ignored for printing.

  If reading or writing registration info fails,
  display error message.

  If you try to install GSview in the same directory
  as a previous version, the setup program now launches 
  uninstaller for the previous version.

  When using pstoedit with a multipage document and a backend
  that does not support multiple pages, process the selected
  page instead of the currently displayed page.

  Updated pstoedit to v3.21.

  Easy Configure should always show a dialog, even if only
  one version of Ghostscript installed.

OS/2:
  Added pstoedit code from Thomas Hoffmann.
  This doesn't work yet - pstoedit DLL needs to be recompiled
  with different link options.
  
  Enabled Edit | Measure.

----------------------
Version 3.4 2000-07-29
----------------------
All:
  This is based on 3.3 with some bug fixes which were in 3.31 alpha.

  "gsview /F filename" didn't print any pages.

  The pdfmark fix for user space coordinates was broken if
  link had dashed border.

Win32:
  Advanced PS print options were not saved correctly.

  Fixed incorrect use of memset in gsprint.cpp main().

  When configuring GSview, don't ask which version of Ghostscript
  to use if only one version of Ghostscript installed.
  Don't forget to open file on command line.

----------------------------
Version 3.32alpha 2000-07-18
----------------------------
X11:
  Added window for showing GS stdout while printing.
  Added text extract and find.
  Added Measure CTM.
  Now supports all 5 languages.
  Added Advanced PS Print dialog.

----------------------------
Version 3.31alpha 2000-07-08
----------------------------
All:
  This is based on 3.21 alpha with the 3.3 fixes.

  "gsview /F filename" didn't print any pages.

  The pdfmark fix for user space coordinates was broken if
  link had dashed border.

Win32:
  Pressing F4 when in fullscreen mode brought up overlapped
  window and left it in front.

  Fixed incorrect use of memset in gsprint.cpp main().
  
  Advanced PS print options were not saved correctly.

  Removed Win16 code.

  When configuring GSview, don't ask which version of Ghostscript
  to use if only one version of Ghostscript installed.
  Don't forget to open file on command line.

X11:
  Doesn't die if Ghostscript can't be found.

  GS command can be set.

  Changes to support multiple languages.

  Set locale correctly.

----------------------
Version 3.3 2000-07-01
----------------------
All:
  This is an out of sequence release to fix two bugs.
  This is based on the GSview 3.1 sources and ignores any
  changes introduced in 3.21 alpha.

  "gsview /F filename" now uses "File | Convert".

Win32:
  Fixed yet another bug in Windows GDI printing, introduced
  in 3.2.  This bug caused the output to be horizontally
  shifted if black & white or colour rendering was used.

----------------------------
Version 3.21alpha 2000-06-30
----------------------------
All:
  There should be no change to function.

Win32:
  Button bar moved from left to top, status bar from top to bottom.

X11:
  Alpha test of new port to X11/Unix using Gtk toolkit.
  Many features not yet working.

----------------------
Version 3.2 2000-06-30
----------------------
All:
  If document did not contain a trailer, some EPS and printing
  operations would fail.

----------------------
Version 3.1 2000-06-27
----------------------
All:
  pdfmark uses user space coordinates, not default user space.

  Fixed gvcdll.cpp to keep quotes around Ghostscript options.

  Windows incorrectly removes the quotes around profile values,
  which meant that uniprint filenames containing spaces were
  not enclosed in quotes and gvwgs didn't work.  
  If first character of printer option is @, put quotes around 
  the whole option.

Win32:
  Added DDE command [FullScreen()].

  Fixed drawing of bitmaps on Windows 95, which followed the Win16
  CreatePatternBrush documentation, not the Win32 documentation.

  Fixed Print dialog for Windows NT4 & 2000 with non-English support
  which sometimes uses a different dialog structure.

  Select uniprint options correctly after uniprint dialog used
  for first time.

  Fixed trashed memory heap when printing using GDI and converting 
  palette from 24-bit colour to monochrome to save space.

  Windows GDI printing didn't work on some computers because some
  new DOCINFO structure fields were not being initialised.

----------------------
Version 3.0 2000-06-15
----------------------
All:
  Updated Italian translation.

  Updated Spanish translation.

  German translation still needs updating for the Printing and
  Conversion topics.

  French translation still needs updating.

---------------------------
Version 2.94beta 2000-06-01
---------------------------
All:
  Debug flag /d8 appends Ghostscript messages to the file
  c:\gsview.txt.  Useful for post-mortem debugging.

  If %%DocumentMedia describes only one media, and default %%PageMedia 
  is missing, assume that media is the default.

  Fixed GPF caused by GSview closing an already closed file when a
  PostScript error occurred while extracting text.

  Fixed GPF when DSC scanner found %%BeginData: 
  without any parameters.  Generate warning message instead.

  Updated Italian translation.

  Updated German translation.  Still needs a bit more work on
  the help file.

  Added Spanish translation.

Win32:
  Fixed printing for Win32s.  Win32s comdlg32.dll did not contain
  the print dialog template and we can't load the template from
  the 16-bit commdlg.dll.  For Win32s, keep a local copy of the 
  Windows 3.1 print dialog template (English only).

  Added DDE commands [ShowWindow(nCmdShow)].  The integer value nCmdShow 
  is the same as for the Windows API ShowWindow(hWnd, nCmdShow).
  If SW_SHOW or SW_SHOWMAXIMISED or SW_SHOWNORMAL are used, 
  GSview will be made the foreground window.
  "gsview32 /E" now brings window to the front using [ShowWindow(1)].

  gsview32 /S"printer name" now works.  GSview exits after file
  has been spooled.

  GSview now follows the system colours.  If the window background
  colour is white, an alternative is chosen to allow the edge of 
  a white page to be seen.

  Updated libbz2.dll to bzip2 1.0.0.

---------------------------
Version 2.93beta 2000-04-18
---------------------------
All:
  Any line that starts with %%Begin now terminates the comments
  section.

  "gsview32 /p filename" now prints without prompting, then exits.
  This uses the printer and print method most recently used by GSview.
  If print to file is used, you will still get the "Save as" dialog.
  
Win32:
  When uninstalling, don't delete non empty registry keys
  so the registration information is not deleted when someone
  uninstalls GSview prior to installing a new version.

  Use GetFileTime() to avoid VC++ 5.0 multithreaded bug in fstat()
  which caused GSview to continually reopen files.

  Fix word padding of Print common dialog template structure.
  By chance it was correct for English, but wrong for German.

  Setup program writes "App Paths" key and values so GSview
  can be run from the start menu or the command line as 
  "start gsview32".

  When using "Windows GDI printer", an attempt to close GSview
  before printing has finished results in a warning dialog.

OS/2:
  IDR_EPSFWARN was always being sent, because IDR_VIEWER didn't
  have a terminating null.

---------------------------
Version 2.92beta 2000-04-01
---------------------------
All:
  Fixed %%PaperSize: null pointer access.

  Don't pause when showpage executed in trailer.

  Ignore a few more common DSC comments that don't concern
  GSview.

Win32:
  Fixed /t command line option.
 

---------------------------
Version 2.91beta 2000-03-12
---------------------------
Win32:
  Don't start gvwgs32.exe with pipe method when converting.

All:
  Fixed memory leaks and allocation problems in new DSC code.
  Memory allocation debugging using /d4.
  Fixed displaying of PDF files.

----------------------
Version 2.9 2000-03-19
----------------------
All:
  This is an out of sequence bug fix release to handle an 
  installation problem with using Ghostscript #.01 - #.09.
  This is based on the GSview 2.8 sources and ignores nearly all
  changes in GSview 2.81 beta.

  Italian translation updates.

  Fixed version numbers in help files.

  When using the pdfwrite device, add "-c save pop -f" to avoid 
  a font bug in Ghostscript 6.0.

Win32:
  When compiling gvceps.h with MSVC++, you must use #pragma pack(1).
  epstool would crash because this was not used.

---------------------------
Version 2.81beta 2000-03-17
---------------------------
Win32:
  When compiling gvceps.h with MSVC++, you must use #pragma pack(1).
  epstool would crash because this was not used.

  Change print dialog to use a modified version of the common
  print dialog.  Options added to this for printing GDI, GS device
  or PostScript printer.  Select page button added.
  Printing of even/odd is possible for non DSC files.
  Printing with GDI tells Ghostscript to render the pages to bitmaps,
  and then sends the bitmaps to the GDI.  It is more optimised
  than mswinpr2.  

  Fixed BC++ 4.5 makefile.  This can't build the setup program
  since BC++ 4.5 predates the shell explorer interface.

  VC++ makefile now calls BC++ 4.5 makefile to compile the
  16-bit gsv16spl.exe.

  Distribute gsprint with GSview.  Added -twoup to gsprint.

All:
  Tim Theisen's ps.c module has been replaced by a new
  DSC parser written in C++.
  This new code attempts to recognise incorrectly embedded
  EPS files (i.e. missing %%BeginDocument: / %%EndDocument).

  Compile all sources as C++.

  Changed gvceps.cpp so it works if byte packing of structures
  is not used.  It might now work with big endian architectures.

  Italian translation updates.
  
  Modified gvceps.cpp so that it should work with big-endian
  architecture and non byte packing.
  
  When opening a file from the command line, or dropping a file
  on GSview, change the current directory to match the file.
  Needed to display \aladdin\gs6.0\examples\chess.ps.

  Added registration nag dialog.

  Debug /d now supports some bitfield qualifiers.
  /d1 is default
  /d2 is debug Windows GDI printing.

  Accept PDF files with UNC names, by duplicating backslashes
  instead of converting them to forward slashes.

  Rearranged printing topics to separate printing and conversion.
  Hopefully this makes things a little clearer.

  When using the pdfwrite device, add "-c save pop -f" to avoid 
  a font bug in Ghostscript 6.0.

----------------------
Version 2.8 2000-02-17
----------------------
All:
  French translation updates.

Win32:
  Allow GSview to use new pstoedit DLL version 301, which 
  includes a function to release the driver info memory.
  The old version 300 is still supported (and is included with
  GSview 2.8), but it will leak memory.
  
OS/2:
  When printing to "PostScript Printer", the queue name is now
  correctly selected based on the previous use.

---------------------------
Version 2.76beta 2000-02-08
---------------------------
All:
  Added Italian translation of help file and updated resources.

  Modified pstotext to work with GS 6.0.

  Added 'View | Fit Window' which changes the resolution to make 
  the page fit in the current window.  Repeated use changes 
  between fitting width or height to window.
  Helpful when displaying full screen.

  When displaying full screen, redraw only on showpage, not on 
  erasepage (i.e. ignore GSDLL_SYNC).  This is to stop the screen 
  flashing when using GSview for a slide show.

  Stopped "EPS Warn" from causing errors when an attempt to change
  the page size was used.

Win32:
  When the page is smaller than the window, centre it.  
  Previously it was displayed in the top left corner of the window.
  Helpful when displaying full screen.

  Bug fixes to batch setup.

  Setup now creates file associations.

  GSview was crashing when trying to free memory allocated by
  the pstoedit DLL.  This code has been disabled (causing a
  memory leak) until changes have been made to pstoedit to 
  provide a way for pstoedit to free this memory.

  Updates for the DEC Alpha.

OS/2:
  Setup will try to guess the version number of Ghostscript
  by looking in the current directory for a file named gsNNNos2.zip
  where NNN is between GS_REVISION and GS_REVISION_MAX.

  Add "View | Full Screen"

  "Edit | Measure" is not available due to a mysterious crash
  probably due to bad code generated by the compiler.

---------------------------
Version 2.75beta 2000-01-24
---------------------------
All:
  Added "Rotate Media" to Media menu.  This provides an easy
  way to get A4 landscape, without having to use the User Size.
  This is cleared whenever a DSC document sets the page size.

  Added "Fixed Media" option to print dialog.
  When selected (the default), page size is fixed by the Media menu.  
  Ghostscript will rotate landscape pages to fit on this fixed size.
  This allows Ghostscript to print landscape [842 595] pages on
  portrait [595 842] paper automatically.

  Fixed ps.c with MSC and made it more tolerant of \r.

  Added DSC dump for debug.

  For setpagedevice, policies are in /Policies not /Policy.

  Italian is using the English help file.

  Even if Save Settings is disabled, the most recently used 
  file names are now saved to INI file.

  Default is now to use anti-aliasing (alpha=4)

Win32:
  Setup program now updates autoexec.bat with SET TEMP=c:\
  and creates autoexec.bat if needed.

  Language resource files compiled with MSVC++ no longer 
  contain code, halving their size.

OS/2:
  Resource fixes for Italian translation.

---------------------------
Version 2.74beta 2000-01-14
---------------------------
All:
  Added Italian translation of menus and dialogs.  Help file 
  not yet translated.
  README.TXT converted to HTML (Readme.htm).

Win32:
  Adding folder to start menu for All Users incorrectly 
  did it for current user.
  Setup program can skip creating Start Menu folder and items.
  Added View Readme and View Help buttons to setup program.

---------------------------
Version 2.73beta 2000-01-11
---------------------------
All:
  pdf_check_tag overflowed a buffer and trashed the stack if a
  pdfmark was too long.

Win32:
  Added bzip2 DLL, to uncompress bz2 files similar to gz files.
  Much more advanced setup program.
  Change configure into "Easy Configure" and "Advanced Configure".

---------------------------
Version 2.72beta 1999-09-15
---------------------------
All:
  Find and links didn't set page history; go back page didn't work.
  When GSview added EPS header to PS file, it was incorrectly
  adding %BeginDocument instead of %%BeginDocument

  Works with Aladdin Ghostscript 5.93 beta.

  Valid GS version now 4.03 -> 6.99

  German and French translations still need to be updated.

  Ghostscript files are now in subdirectories bin, lib, doc, 
  fonts, examples (same as Unix arrangement).

Win:
  DDE code wasn't disabled properly before initialisation.

OS/2:
  No testing yet.

Win16:
  Not distributed.  Please use GSview 2.7.

-----------------------
Version 2.71 1999-01-11
-----------------------
Win32:
  Updated to work with pstoedit 3.0.  Released only in self
  extracting archive which installs gsview32.exe and pstoedit 3.01.

----------------------
Version 2.7 1998-12-23
----------------------
All:
  Changed email address to gsview@ghostgum.com.au.
  GSview is now owned by Ghostgum Software Pty Ltd,
  ACN 085 392 632.
  Text extraction can now cope with pstotext incorrectly
  returning more than one word at a time.
  Updated to pstotext 1.8.

  Items missing from this release due to lack of time are:
  - Translations (some English words appear in the French and
    German versions).
  - Edit | Measure in OS/2.
  - Convert to vector format doesn't work because the pstoedit
    DLL isn't included.
Win:
  Edit | Measure dialog box allows distances to be measured,
  and custom coordinates to be displayed.
  View | Full Screen displays the image full screen.  
  Shortcut is F4, Escape returns to normal display.

Win32:
  Registry entries for file associations now handle spaces in
  GSview path.

---------------------------
Version 2.61beta 1998-11-03
---------------------------
All:
  Put quotes around the uniprint configuration file name.
  Updated to pstotext 1.7, needed for GS 5.50.
  Add -dFIXEDMEDIA when using pstotext to prevent the 
  page size of the nullpage device from being changed.
  Fixed pstotext bug with Dvips Cork Encoding.
  Added .prn to default file filter.
  Increase stack space to 65536 for gs thread.
  PDF displaying now honours orientation menu.
  PDF displaying will use CropBox if EPSF Clip is enabled.
  Added "Go Back" and "Go Forward" menu items which remember
  the order of previously viewed pages.  These will eventually
  be used by the PDF Annotation /Page /GoBack.
  When printing an EPS file, make sure it contains one
  and only one showpage.  If an EPS file doesn't fit on
  the page, rescale it.
  When extracting pages from a PDF file, instruct user to
  use Print to File using pdfwrite or pswrite.
  Cursor units can be displayed in finer resolution.
  Added Advanced PostScript Options to printer setup to
  add Ctrl+D and prolog/epilog files.
  Widened fields on status bar.
  When filename given on command line, don't use it until
  after the configure wizard has finished.
  
Win:
  Filenames on command line are converted to fully qualified
  names.
  Added /E command line option to open file in existing GSview.
  Added /X command line option to close existing GSview.
  Added DDE server, service="GSview", topic="GSview", which
  understands the commands 
    [FileOpen("filename")]
    [FileExit()]
    [NextPage()]
    [PrevPage()]
    [GoBack()]
    [GotoPage(5)]
    [Command("command line")]
  The last one only understands "filename" or "/P filename".
  Don't sent multiple commands together.  GSview won't complain,
  but the multithreaded asynchrononous execution within GSview
  means that the first command won't have been completed before
  the second command is received.  If you need to send multiple
  commands, send them separately and with pauses inbetween.

Win32:
  Convert all path names to the short form before calling the
  ProgMan DDE interface.  This should make the GS start menu
  item work correctly when using long path names.
  Fixed pstotext makefile for MS VC++.
  Fixed GS_DLL yet again - it was inserting an extra backslash.
  Added interface to Wolfgang Glunz's pstoedit.

OS/2:
  Turn off hard error reporting when changing directory.
  This is to avoid getting an error popup when starting GSview
  when the last directory is inaccessible (e.g. removable media).
  gvpgs.exe was crashing due to insufficient stack space in
  the gs thread.

----------------------
Version 2.6 1998-09-17
----------------------
All:
  Fixed some Unix compilation problems with epstool.
  Fixed several bugs in reopening changed document on activation.
  Updated Ghostscript icons to new Artifex Ghostscript logo.
  When installing non default GS version, the setup program
  wrote the GS version to the INI file, but GSview ignored this.

Win32:
  Reversed mouse wheel horizontal scroll using left mouse button.
  When too much text was added to the Ghostscript message window,
  it couldn't be displayed.
  Fixed GS_DLL written by setup program.
  Fixed start menu item for Ghostscript README which is now Readme.htm.

----------------------------
Version 2.51 beta 1998-08-23
----------------------------
All:
  Updated epstool.  Page calculation for descending page order was 
  wrong;  If a multipage non-EPS file was used as input, the 
  output didn't contain the correct single page (or copied garbage).
  Removed DOS EOL characters and ^Z from epstool tar file.
  Made Select Page dialog box wider.
  If within %%Begin/EndDocument, ignore %MSEPS Preamble. 
  (John DiBiasi, 10 April 1998).
  When GSview is activated, check if open document has been changed -  
  if so and "Option | Auto Redisplay", reload and redisplay it.
Win:
  Borland C++ getenv("USERPROFILE") returns filenames in OEM character 
  set, but the Windows API for reading INI files needed the filename in 
  the ANSI character set.  This stopped user profile INI files working 
  if non ASCII characters were used. (Ruediger Ullrich, 31 March 1998).
  If USERPROFILE used, but it did not point to a directory, GSview
  failed to write the INI file.  Under this fault condition it now 
  writes it in the default location, the windows directory. 

Win32:
  Fixed Ghostscript registry keys GS_LIB and GS_DLL written by
  setup program.

OS/2:
  Fixed problem with parts of the frame window being omitted in
  foreign language (far eastern) versions of OS/2.
  (Steffen Klupsch, 6 April 1998).

----------------------
Version 2.5 1998-02-20
----------------------
Win:
  Added support for mouse wheel.  
    No modifier = vertical scroll.
    Left button = horizontal scroll.
    Shift = change page,
    Ctrl = change resolution by a factor of 1.2.

----------------------------------
Version 2.44 beta 1998-01-14
----------------------------------
All:
  Put sources for each language in a separate directory.
  Added partial provision for Italian language.
  Look for zlib DLL on search path as well as GSview directory.
  Fixed Goto Page dialog problem with duplicate page labels.
  When extracting pages from a PostScript file, omit leading ^D
  or PJL commands.
  Made print "Reverse Pages" sticky.  It is not sticky for
  extracting pages.
  Added -dCompatibilityLevel=1.1 to pdfwrite properties.
Win32:
  If ProfileDirectory named value in registry doesn't contain
  a directory name, ignore it.
  Added explanation "DLL not found" for error 1157 when loading 
  GS DLL.

----------------------------------
Version 2.43 beta 1997-12-19
----------------------------------
All:
  Removed a few small memory leaks.
  uniprint device was being given an incorrect size because
  the resolution is unknown.  Use -dDEVICEWIDTHPOINTS instead
  of -dDEVICEWIDTH for this device.
  Goto Page dialog box now has an edit field so you can type
  a page number directly.
Win:
  Changed setup/configure logs.  Registry changes are now saved
  as two ordinary REGEDIT4 files, containing before and after state.  
  Program Manager settings are saved as a set of DDE commands.
  Added an uninstall program.  Like all install programs, this 
  works best if you uninstall in the opposite order of installing.
  If you install GSview twice, the uninstall won't be as clean.

----------------------------------
Version 2.42 beta 1997-12-13
----------------------------------
All:
  When calculating bounding box from non-white pixels, round the 
  area outwards by 1 pixel in each direction.
  "GSview Print" (gvpgs/gvwgs) displays % complete in title bar.
  Added uniprint button to Print dialog box.  This brings up a
  list of available uniprint configuration files.
  Added Reverse page option for print and extract.
  If a single contiguous block of pages is selected, Odd and Even buttons
  will select pages within that range.
  Advance to next page when "Page Down" at end of page.
  Go back to previous page when "Page Up" at top of page.
Win:
  GSview starts "GSview Print" minimized.
  Fixed /S"printer queue".
  Complain if no file for /S.
  Exit after successful /S, /P or /F.

----------------------------------
Version 2.4 (rerelease) 1997-11-30
----------------------------------
All:
 doc2html will now write out <IMG SRC="file.gif"> if it finds
 {bml* file.bmp}.
Win:
 Changed dialog font to "MS Sans Serif".  These were originally
 all "Helv" to allow operation on Windows 3.0, but the Borland
 Resource Workshop changed one of these to "MS Sans Serif".
 The result was that on a system without "Helv", the configure
 dialog windows were too large for their parent dialog.
Win16:
 Stopped gsview16.exe attempting to unload itself while still
 running.
 Increased the stack size of gsview16.exe to stop it crashing
 Windows on exit.

----------------------
Version 2.4 1997-11-25
----------------------
All:
 When writing TIFF 6 previews with packbits compression,
 some input sequences caused excessive expansion of the
 data which trashed the heap.  Fixed the relevant part
 of the packbit code.
 Moved English language resources to main EXE, so they
 are always available.
 Corrected EPS Warn message for /statusdict.
 Drawing percentage went negative when file was longer 
 than (2^31 / 100) = 22 Mbytes.
 Added GS_OPTIONS/-dFIXEDMEDIA to Common Problems in help file.
 Added note on converting PS to PDF using GSview in help file.
Win:
 Recent versions wrote a logfile when configuring GSview.
 This caused GSview configuration to fail if the GSview
 directory was read only.  Carry on normally if logfile
 can't be created.
 When reading printer resolutions, the wrong INI file was
 read, resulting in the resolution listbox being disabled.
Win32:
 Added MS Visual C++ 5.0 makefile and changes to sources.
 Changes for DEC Alpha Windows NT.  Associated DLLs (pstotext,
 unzip, zlib) not yet compiled for the DEC Alpha.
 Recompiled zlib32.dll to be MULTIPLE SHARED so it can be
 used by multiple copies of GSview.
 
----------------------
Version 2.3 1997-09-16
----------------------
All:
 File name filters now include .gz extension for PS/EPS/PDF files.
 Fixed cursor coordinates for landscape and seascape (broken when
 %%PageOrientation added).
 Fixed pstotext text extraction when landscape or seascape.
 Accept negative angles in PDF /Rotate.
 Update to pstotext to handle landscape documents correctly.
 Assume that an invalidexit when opening display device is really
 a limitcheck from no memory, so reduce page size and resolution.
PM:
 Increase text limit for configure wizard edit fields.

----------------------------
Version 2.21 beta 1997-08-02
----------------------------
All:
 Added French translation.
 Added epswrite, pswrite, pxlmono and pxlcolor to the list of
 devices known by GSview.
 INI file in GSview directory will override user INI file
 when upgrading or running first time.  This allows network
 admin to avoid users seeing config wizard.
 Config wizard changed to that "Look for additional Type 1 fonts"
 is now "Search for ...". The directory specified is now used
 as -sFONTPATH="..." rather than just appending it to the GS LIB path.
 Config wizard now adds -dNOPLATFONTS.
 Added recent 4 files to File menu.
 Updated licence to Aladdin Free Public Licence version 6.
Win:
 Allow per user INI file for Windows.  Use registry entry for
 Windows 4, or environment variable USERPROFILE if no registry entry.
PM:
 Fixed doc2ipf.c to allow apostrophes within topic names, as 
 required by French.

----------------------
Version 2.2 1997-06-27
----------------------
All:
 Allow user to enter 5.0 as the GS version number instead of
 requiring 5.00.
 Added "Options" edit field to Printer Setup dialog.  This is to allow
 adding "gamma.ps" or "@printer.upp" to the print command line.  This 
 is stored on a per printer basis in the INI file.
 Changed where PageOffset is stored in INI file.
 Avoid bug in GS 5.0 and 5.01 by patching /.runstringbegin
 German language help file isn't up to date.  The Ghostscript
 installation section needs updating.
Win:
 Fixed bug restricting magnitude of page offset.
Win16:
 Don't put quotes around EXE name in exec_pgm().  This stopped
 gvwgs16.exe from running under Windows 3.1, but not Windows 95.

----------------------------
Version 2.12 beta 1997-06-16
----------------------------
All:
 Works with Aladdin Ghostscript 4.03 - 5.99.
 GS 5.0 doesn't run well with GSview because gsdll.execute_cont()
 does not return error codes (i.e. it always returns zero).
 When extracting DOS EPS PostScript or preview, don't get stuck in
 an infinite loop when DOS EPS header has bad lengths.
 Display error message if DOS EPS header has bad lengths.
 Fixed bug (reversed triples) in TIFF 4 preview when depth 
 was 24 bits/pixel.
 Don't change orientation menu selection when displaying PDF, 
 just disable the menu.
 Changed the behaviour of "Fit Window to Page" so that window can
 now enlarge as well as reduce in size.
 Fixed wildcard matching so *.pdf will now match both a.pdf and 
 a.b.pdf.  This affected the file type filter used in OS/2.

----------------------------
Version 2.11 beta 1997-05-26
----------------------------
All:
 Ignore reversed bounding box values when using EPSF Clip.
 Fixed memory leak when displaying PDF files which contain links.
 Use zlib DLL to uncompress gzipped files.
 Handle Latin-1 accented characters.
 Major change to setup program - now looks like install wizard.
 Added configure wizard to GSview.
 Added "Orientation | Auto".  The remaining items on the orientation
 menu are no longer changed by DSC documents.
 Auto orientation now supports %%PageOrientation.
PM:
 Changed the Frame window formatting to work correctly under Far East
 versions of OS/2 (which have extra child windows).
Win16:
 Is available again.  Hopefully it won't get much use.
Win32:
 Language DLLs were marked as MULTIPLE SHARED.  This didn't allow
 them to be loaded multiple times under Win32s.  Tried changing them
 to SINGLE SHARED.  This should allow them to be loaded multiple times 
 under Win32s, but it doesn't.  SINGLE SHARED also prevented two copies
 of GSview running under WinNT.  Changed back to MULTIPLE SHARED.
 When a second copy of GSview started under Win32s, give command
 line to first copy and then exit.

----------------------
Version 2.1 1996-11-04
----------------------
All:
 German translation updates.
PM:
 When first run, ask "Select Language" if GSview language doesn't match
 OS/2 language.

----------------------------
Version 2.04 beta 1996-10-25
----------------------------
All:
 Remember printer queue names and print to file names separately
 to prevent Open File dialog box from trying to display a printer.
 Crashed when quick text search attempted on PDF file.
 German translation updates.
 Don't get stuck in "Wait..." state when attempting, but failing,
 to load pstotext a second time.
PM:
 Help buttons were broken when language resources moved to DLL.
 Palette for old bitmap was wrong.

----------------------------
Version 2.03 beta 1996-10-17
----------------------------
All:
 Added pstotext dvips Cork Encoding option.
 Options | Quick Text is now Options | PStoText | Disabled.
 Still needs a few documentation fixes for German.
 Changed doc2xxx programs to get title from first line of file.
PM:
 Printing was broken when language resources moved to DLL.
 Don't list printers that are connected to FILE, because
 printing to them from a non-PM thread locks up PM.
Win32:
 Fixed scroll bar redraw bug in WinNT 4.0.

----------------------------
Version 2.02 beta 1996-10-10
----------------------------
All:
 Split the language specific resources into a separate DLL,
 so a single GSview EXE now dynamically loads the selected 
 language resources.
 Bug with Zoom was causing GSview to jump to first page.
 Full German translation.

----------------------------
Version 2.01 beta 1996-09-20
----------------------------
All:
 German translation by Thomas Pfeiffer.
 Added pdfmark code for /LNK links
 Fixed handling of PDF files with non zero /Rotate.
 Ignore Orientation menu for PDF files.
 Allow resolution to be set for pdfwrite device.
 When using File | Extract on PDF file, extract PS instead of
 just writing a wrapper.
 If limitcheck when opening display device, reset page size and resolution. 
 Fixed LF only problem in pstotext.txt
 Added OS/2 and Win32 command line pstotext EXEs which use pstotext DLL.
 Force Text/GraphicsAlpha=1 if depth<8, to avoid setpagedevice error.
 Changed large page size warning to 2m x 2m.
 Fixed "User Defined" page size on startup.
 Ignore SYNC after GSview generated setpagedevice, to avoid 
 unnecessary redraw.
 Previously the EPSF Clip was needed when writing a preview.  Now the
 clipping will happen automatically.
 Orientation must be portrait when adding an EPS preview.
 Automatically calculate bbox from non white pixels.  Old method of 
 manually clicking at left, bottom, right and top is still available.
 Made "Print to File" sticky.
 Can now create WMF previews bigger than 64k, by segmenting
 into a number of bitmaps each < 64k.
 WMF preview is written directly, without using GDI APIs.
 TIFF 6 preview supports colour, uncompressed or compressed with packbits.
 File | Print has checkbox "PostScript Printer" which is similar
 to Extract followed by Print File.
 Recover when current file deleted and new file opened.
 Don't lock up or use 100% CPU when File | Close and already closed.
Win:
 Reduce the number of redraws when displaying found text.
 Allow Print to File, even when no Windows printers installed.
 Remember if window is maximized.
Win16:
 Compiles and runs.  It is not intended to make this available precompiled.
PM:
 Put gvpm.ico in the same directory as gvpm.exe, to help WPS find
 the correct icon.
 Changed file dialog box behaviour.  "Type of file" now controls a 
 file extension filter instead of an EA filter.
 Now supports os2prn driver for printing (slowly) using any OS/2
 printer driver that supports bitmaps.
 Can now add WMF preview.

----------------------
Version 2.0 1996-08-11
----------------------
All:
 First non-beta release to use the new Ghostscript DLL.
 Allow zoom and auto-redisplay of single page EPS files.
 When closing a non-DSC file, abort without displaying too many 
 of the remaining pages.
 When displaying DSC files with Special page order, warn the user
 if they attempt to reorder pages.
 Redisplay of DSC file with special page order now moves to first page.
 Skip over PJL (HP LaserJet) prologue.
 Change Info dialog box to display 'Ctrl-D followed by' or
 'PJL followed by'
 Allow 'PS to EPS' for 0 page DSC files.
 Disable zoom button while using 'PS to EPS'.
 Disabled painting when GSview being closed.

-----------------------------
Version 1.63 beta  1996-08-06
-----------------------------
All:
 Installation program replaces Ghostscript gs_init.ps with 
 a copy that has the -dSAFER/-dDELAYBIND bug fixed.
 Text find using pstotext has implied wildcard before and after
 search string.
 Prompt for search string or page range before creating text 
 index file.
 Abort text extract if pending operation.
 ps.c was not skipping over trailing ) of (text) in gettext()
Win32:
 Only show wait cursor over image window.  Use normal cursor over
 menu, status and button bars.  User can now see that GSview is
 not totally unresponsive and can now cause more chaos.
 Don't close GSview window until after Ghostscript is unloaded.
PM:
 Copy marked text to clipboard now works.
 Scrolling redraws correctly, but only for non palette manager
 displays.  For palette manager displays, keyboard scrolling works 
 correctly, but mouse scrolling causes WM_REALIZEPALETTE which causes 
 complete repaint.
 Reset page count when redisplaying non DSC document.


-----------------------------
Version 1.62 beta  1996-08-02
-----------------------------
All:
 PDF text search/extract using pstotext.
 Added hotkeys Ctrl+F and F3 for searching.
 Improved pstotext searching to use wildcards '*' and '?' in
 and sensible combination.  Default search range is all pages.
 PDF zoom now works provided /Rotate is 0.
 PDF files with nonzero /Rotate display correctly (except for zoom).
 Fixed bug with 'Open' not working after some files.

Win32:
 Disable printer queue/port list box when mswinpr2 device selected.
 Configuration can now add PDF file type to registry.
PM:
 Scrolling of window is currently incorrect.  More than the exposed
 area is being redrawn.  
 Copy marked text to clipboard doesn't work.

-----------------------------
Version 1.61 beta  1996-07-29
-----------------------------
All:
 This is a wide beta release, which will cease to work on 1996-09-01
 Fixed /P printing from command line.
 Support for pstotext text extraction.
 Option "Quick Text" selects between the quick and dirty text
 extraction and the better, but slower pstotext.
 pstotext is not included in this version of GSview.
 Added hotkeys >/< for increase/decrease resolution by 1.2.
 Can install to a UNC name under Win95, but not Win3.1.

 This is a wide beta release, which will cease to work on 1996-09-01
Win32:
 Fixed parsing of gvwgs.exe command line with embedded spaces.
 Fixed Win32s "Print File"
 When checking if file datetime has changed, ignore time if getftime()
 returns datetime=0.  This appears to be a C RTL or Win32s bug.
 Disabled button help when GSview is not the active window.

-----------------------------
Version 1.45 beta  1996-06-25
-----------------------------
All:

 Added expiry date for betas.
 Fixed code for opening display device.
Win32:
 Added "Fit Window to Page"
 Fixed zoom when bitmap smaller than window.

-----------------------------
Version 1.44 beta  1996-06-19
-----------------------------
All:
 Read printer list from ini file instead of resources, to help
 network installation.
 Move most of configuration from setup program to GSview, to allow
 network installation and running directly from a CD-ROM.

-----------------------------
Version 1.43 beta  1996-06-15
-----------------------------
All:
 Fixed Text Find bug.
 PDF now sets page size correctly.  Zoom only works if GSview page size
 matches the PDF page size.
Win32:
 Fixed ATM Fontmap install bug.
 Fixed lockup on single threaded Ghostscript error.
 Button help now works, but interferes with F1 accelerator.
PM:
 Now available again.

 Printing uses the gvpgs or gvwgs program to load the GS DLL.
 Removed redundant "File | Print To File".
 Multithreading support common to Win and PM.
 /T option to enable/disable multithreading.
Win16:
 Win16 is no longer supported - use Win32s instead, or preferably Win95.
Win32:

 under Win32s.
 Added Options TextAlphaBits and GraphicsAlphaBits for anti-aliasing.
PM:
 Not yet available.

----------------------
Version 1.4 1996-01-10
----------------------
All:
 File was being opened twice if file was changed.
 Should be used with Aladdin Ghostscript 3.53.
Win16:
 Prevented GPF when running out of memory.
 Reduced stack size and pipe buffer size to allow larger documents
 to be displayed.  If only numeric page labels are used, 500 page
 documents should be OK.
PM:
 Requires emx 0.9b or later.
 PDF viewing was broken when "Configure Ghostscript" was added.

----------------------------
Version 1.33 beta 1995-11-30

----------------------------
Version 1.31 beta 1995-11-03
----------------------------
This is an interim release, intended to fix some known problems
and add a few new features, but does not include the full DLL
implementation needed to work reliably under Windows 95/NT,
or paper size handling using level 2 setpagedevice.
It is intended for use with Aladdin Ghostscript 3.51.
All:
 Still doesn't work with landscape PostScript that sets the
 clipping path.
 Combined printer dialog boxes.
 Allow user supplied preview file in creation of DOS EPS file for both 
 GSview "Edit | Add EPS Preview | User Supplied Preview" and EPSTOOL.
 Added warning if EPS BoundingBox was entirely off the page.
 Replace label of "%%Pages: () 1" with page number.
 Changed "Ghostscript Command" into "Configure Ghostscript" which
 has separate "Ghostscript EXE" and "Ghostscript Include Path".
 Changed TIFF code to work on big-endian architectures, to allow
 EPSTOOL to run under Solaris.
 Directories src, gsgrab and epstool are now in ZIP files, since
 most people won't want them unzipped.
PM:
 Uses print queues instead of writing to ports.
 It is now possible to use a Ghostscript path with embedded spaces.
 Allow user to specify drawing method GpiDrawBits or WinDrawBitmap
 to dodge display driver bugs.
 Recover when last directory is invalid (usually no floppy in drive).
Win:
 Added Ghostscript 3.51 to "Options | Ghostscript Version".  Selecting
 GS 3.51 puts quotes around filenames in response files to allow embedded
 spaces.  This won't work with GS 3.33.
Win32:
 Uses print queues under Win95 and WinNT.


----------------------------
Version 1.3       1995-05-23
----------------------------
Win:
 Default extension was .ps. Now .ps or .eps or .epi.
 Added mswinpr2 to default device list.
Win32:
 gvcbugs.doc notes that patched version of Ghostscript 3.33 needed to 
 avoid lockups under Windows 95.
 Fixed drag-drop under Win32.
 Allowed long filenames in quotes on command line.
 Win95 "Print File" opens port directly and does not attempt to spool file.

----------------------------
Version 1.23 beta 1995-05-16
----------------------------
All:
 Location of GSview on ftp://ftp.cs.wisc.edu/ghost/rjl/ has changed slightly.
Win:
 Changed open command dialog box filter strings so that List Files of
 type list box doesn't confuse users.  Some users think that if the 
 extension of a PostScript file is BMP, it can be read by Microsoft Word.
 Changed dialogs to match Windows 95 style.  This involved changed
 default font to Helv 8 pt, and adding 0x0004L flag to all dialogs.
Win32:
 Increased maximum string length from 80 to 256 characters.
 Added flag to indicate Windows 95.
 Corrected error message under Windows 95 when Ghostscript can't be found.
 Noted that Windows 95 can be used.

----------------------------
Version 1.22 beta 1995-05-09
----------------------------
All:
 Updated device list to match updated gs 3.33 makefiles.
 Added note about gs @filename to GSgrab documentation.
 Added FILE_ID.DIZ for BBS operators.
 Added suggested Windows PostScript printer drivers to help file.
PM:
 Requires emx 0.9a or later.
Win:
 Store bitmaps and icon in binary files instead of embedded in resource 
 script, to allow compilation with Microsoft compilers.

----------------------------
Version 1.21 beta 1995-04-26
----------------------------
PM:
 Can now handle PDF files using GS 3.33 with PDF interpreter.  Zoom
 doesn't work with PDF files.  Takes a long time to open PDF file.  Doesn't
 sense if PDF file is modified.
 
Win32:
 Filename on command line was ignored.  Removed BC++ 4.0 bug avoidance 
 since no longer needed in BC++ 4.5.

----------------------------
Version 1.2 1995-04-18
----------------------------
All:
 Changed email address to rjl@aladdin.com.  This is an alias provided
 by Aladdin Enterprises.  Russell Lang is not an employee or agent
 of Aladdin Enterprises.
 Aladdin Ghostscript 3.33 is now the preferred version for use with GSview.
 Disabled changing HWResolution via setpagedevice.
 Fixed bug in handling %%BeginBinary or %%BeginData with lines > 255
 characters (which is incorrect DSC).
 Now deals with incorrect DSC usage whereby code is included
 after %%EndSetup and before %%Page:  (Microsoft Windows).
 Added warning if User Defined Media dimensions exceed 1 metre.
 Updated documentation to suit GS 3.33.
 Updated printer devices list to suit GS 3.33.
PM:
 Removed double mutex request which may have been causing mutex timeout.
 Show Bounding Box now works in orientations other than portrait
 and when zoomed.
 Sound files with spaces in filename will now play.  Required quotes
 around filename for MciPlayFile().
Win:
 Now compiled using BC++ 4.5.
Win16:
 Add "Options | Ghostscript Version" to allow GNU Ghostscript 2.6.1 
 to be used by GSview.  Support for this is likely to be dropped
 in the future.
Win32:
 Modified get_filename() to deal with buggy Win32 GetOpenFileName
 which didn't change current directory.

----------------------------
Version 1.13 beta 1995-01-09
----------------------------
All:
 Fixed bug which caused looping in ps.c when reading DOS EPS file.
 Added reference to WWW home page.
 Add ghostscript installation instructions to help file.
PM:
 Added small black and white icons for OS/2 Warp.
 Fixed check marks on Orientation menu.
 Added Ctrl+PgDn and Ctrl+PgUp to page left and right as per IBM CUA.
Win32:
 Fixed bug which stopped gsview32.exe working as a NCSA Mosaic viewer.
 This bug was caused by a buggy BC4 setdisk() function which was incorrectly 
 changing the directory on selected disk.
 Changed INI filename to GSVIEW32.INI

----------------------------
Version 1.12 beta 1994-12-08
----------------------------
All:
 Prevent user entering 0 for width or height of user defined media.
 Created doc2html for making GSview on-line help available via the
 World Wide Web.
 Fixed printing with User Defined page size.
 Reverted to using Tim Theisen's ps.c module, but with a non GNU licence.
 Modified ps.c to support %%BeginData lines > 254 char, atend instead
 of (atend), %!PS-Adobe instead of %!PS-Adobe-, DOS EPS files.
Win:
 If ghostscript window in existence, don't erase background of
 GSview.  This is to avoid an NT bug which resulted in GSview
 being told to erase the background after Ghostscript had drawn 
 the child window.
 Treat Windows 95 (version > 4.0) as being like Windows NT.
 When creating default Ghostscript Command, use gswin32.exe for 32bit
 version, not gswin.
PM:
 Added new option "Show Bounding Box" which draws a dashed rectangle 
 over the image to show the bounding box.  Only works in portrait
 orientation.

----------------------------
Version 1.11 beta 1994-10-27
----------------------------
All:
 Changed "Save Settings" to "Save Settings Now" for consistency with 
 WinNT program manager.
 Changed DSC recognition string from "%!PS-Adobe-" to "%!PS-Adobe"
 to allow it to recognise OS/2 2.99 (Warp Beta) PostScript driver files.
 Allow "%%Pages: atend" and "%%BoundingBox: atend" which are both
 incorrect because they should be "(atend)" not "atend".  Still
 gives warning message about these lines, but accepts them anyway.
 Allow documents that claim DSC conformance to incorrectly include
 a setup section without using %%Begin/EndSetup.  Warning given.
 Allow documents that claim DSC conformance to incorrectly include
 code between %%EndSetup and the first %%Page.
 Add debug messages "%GSview sectionname".
 Moved Page selection menu items to new View menu.
 Added "File | Save As" to save the current document when GSview
 is used as a WWW viewer.
Win:
 Under WinNT, registry entry for [sounds] includes "Enable=1" which caused
 Options|Sounds to crash.  Added code to ignore this entry.
Win32:
 Fixed sounds. Was looking for MMSYSTEM.DLL instead of WINMM.DLL.
 Imitation pipe code changed to use memory mapped files instead
 of shared memory under WinNT.
 WinNT cannot mix 16 and 32 bit versions of Ghostscript and GSview.
 Under WinNT, scroll bars are not redrawn properly, and cursor over
 child window is not correct.
 This problem may be an artifact of the image window
 not being owned by the same process as the parent window.

----------------------------
Version 1.1 1994-08-03
----------------------------
All:
 Change licence from GNU to GSview specific licence.  Commercial
 distribution of this version now prohibited.
 Added Zoom by right mouse button.
 Added Keys Help topic.
 Added pt, mm and inch units to cursor position on status line.
 Cursor position is now w.r.t. lower left of page, not lower left
 of bitmap (relevant when page rotated).
 Force installation help to be displayed when user can't run ghostscript.
 Handle files that claim DSC conformance, yet have lines > 254 characters
 in %%BeginData section (MS-Windows PostScript driver yet again).
PM: When restoring window location on startup, maximize window if 
 needed, remembering restored position.
 Added scrolling bug avoidance kludge for OS/2 2.11, 1bit/pixel bitmap 
 with 1bit/pixel display.
 When GSview started from the command line, ignore any non-existent
 file given as an argument.  Putting GSview on the Desktop menu
 causes d:\Desktop to be given as an argument to GSview.
 Added Options | Fit Window to Page.
 Added new messages GS_BEGIN and GS_END from gsos2.
 These are caused by "-1 false .outputpage" and "-2 false .outputpage"
 respectively.  These commands are placed before and after every page.
 These are used by GSview to tell when gsos2 starts processing input
 and when it finishes processing input.
 This reduces the number of incorrect status messages that get briefly 
 displayed.  Should also make it harder to advance to next page while
 Ghostscript busy.
Win: Draw cursor position on status line directly instead of using
 paint message.  Looks better when cursor in motion.

----------------------------
Version 1.08 beta 1994-05-10
----------------------------
Win16:
 Again loads files from the command line.

Win32: 
 Now loads files from the command line (far pointer in WM_COMMAND 
 lParam was being truncated by Win32s.  Use handle instead).
 Fixed EPS Add Preview | Windows Metafile (BC4 can't tell the
 difference between hwrite and _hwrite!).

PM:
 buttons now in correct place when user tries to resize window
 larger than bitmap.

Wider distribution (ftp.cs.wisc.edu, ftp.cdrom.com).

----------------------------
Version 1.07 beta 1994-04-28
----------------------------

Fixed "gvpm [drive:][path]file" to stay in current directory and to
  pass full pathname to Ghostscript.

Made Auto Redisplay the default.

Changed "Wait" message to be more descriptive.

Fixed redisplay when displayed file is changed.

Shortened gs printer command line by putting filename inside options file.

Merged more of the Windows and PM print code together.

Fixed Windows Select Device dialog box.

Remember port for Open | Print File.

Print all pages when document doesn't contain DSC page comments.

PM Fixes:
 Buttons now drawn correctly when window is maximized.
 In input dialog box, select entry field during dialog box creation.
 Fixed DOS EPS header created by EMX (needed pack(1))
 Fixed Open | Print File.
 Made PM filename box on status line wider.
 Added button descriptions on status bar.

----------------------------
Version 1.06 beta 1994-03-03
----------------------------

Changed name back to GSview (original name used in pre 0.6 alpha) 
to avoid confusion with Tim Theisen's X11 Ghostview.

Ported to OS/2 Presentation Manager.  This involved a major reorganisation 
to allow common code between MS-Windows and OS/2.
MS-Windows version is expected to have more bugs than version 1.0.

PM GSview supports all the relevant features from GSview for Windows
except for "Edit | Add EPS Preview | Windows Metafile".

Added Microsoft Win32s version.  
16 bit GSview for Windows will work with 32 bit Ghostscript using
Win32s and vice versa.
GSview for Windows now requires Ghostscript 3.0.
Not tested under Windows NT.

Added Media | Depth option.  Needs Ghostscript version 3.0.

Added Options | Ignore DSC.  Useful for documents that incorrectly
claim to follow DSC.

Rewrote DSC scanning code.  Now handles DOSEPS files without creating
a temporary file.

Added magnify buttons.

Added text extract and search.

----------------------------
Version 1.0a  1993-11-10
----------------------------

Fixed EPSF Warn bug.

Fixed INI file bug for Printer entry.

----------------------------
Version 1.0  1993-08-05
----------------------------

Saved media name in an array so it is available in write_profile().
Previously, closing gsview from the system menu would cause 
write_profile() to be called twice, the second time after the
window and menu had been destroyed.  Consequently the media
name could not be obtained from the non-existent menu.

Added command line option /S[port] to spool file (File | Print File).
This allows files dropped on the Print Manager to be sent
direct to a PostScript printer.

Changed default timeout to 5 minutes per page.  This timeout 
only affects printing.  Timeout for displaying was dropped
in version 0.8 beta (when pipe code was changed).
Timeout for opening or closing Ghostscript is still 20 seconds.

Added "Safer" option to select Ghostscript -dSAFER flag which
disables the deletefile and renamefile operators, and the
ability to open files in any mode other than read-only.
The default is now "Safer".

Added %%EndImage before %%EndPreview of EPSI preview.

Changed default file extensions so that .ps indicates an ASCII
postscript file and .eps indicates a DOS EPS file with a 
binary header and preview.

----------------------------
Version 0.8 beta  1993-07-07
----------------------------

DSC file is now closed after each page is displayed.  
The file is reopened just before the next page is displayed and 
if the file length or date stamp have changed, gswin is killed 
and the file rescanned.  Version 0.7 kept DSC files open which 
caused problems if another program changed the file.

Documented that gsview produces TIFF 5.0 Class B images.
Added a menu option for creating a TIFF 4.0 preview for 
Word Perfect 5.1 which requires a narrow minded interpretation
of the TIFF 4.0 specification.

Moved imitation pipe code to a separate module.
Changed implementation of imitation pipe.  Instead of creating
many temporary files, gsview now keeps a single read/write file open.
When gsview writes to the imitation pipe the data is written to this file.  
When the pipe is flushed gsview reads the file and passes it to gswin 
in global memory blocks.  When gswin asks for data and there is no more 
to give, gsview resets the file.

If a file is specified on the gsview command line do not use the
saved directory.  If a path to the file is given, use it as the 
current directory, otherwise use the gsview working directory.

To stop documents that change the paper size from interfering with
gsview's orientation commands, gsview now adds paper size commands 
(e.g. letter, a4) to the userdict to replace those in the systemdict.

Generate error if user attempts to overwrite open document file.

----------------------------
Version 0.7 beta  1993-05-10
----------------------------

First general release of Ghostview for Windows.
